# How to submit your project

## 1) Make sure you have everything necessary:
Before you submit, you should have the following:
- A complete CAD model of the case in .STEP format
- Original firmware for your macropad. QMK, KMK, ZMK, etc derivatives are ok!
- A complete BOM (Bill of Materials) with all the parts you would like in a markdown document

Additionally, make sure you meet the following requirements:
- Your design uses a through-hole Seeed XIAO RP2040 as the main MCU
- Your PCB is smaller or equal to 100mmx100mm
- You have less than 20 inputs (switches, encoders, etc)
- Your parts have been approved by me
- The PCB only uses 2 layers

If you have all of that, it should be ready to go!

## Organize your folders
The above is a LOT of files! To make reviewing as easy as possible, your submission format should look like this:
<img src="/docs/examplelayout.png" className="max-w-xl" />

If there's any confusion, ask in #hackpad on the slack!


## Make a PR 
Once everything is organized, you can make a PR to the repository [here](https://github.com/hackclub/hackpad)!

## After making your PR
If everything went correctly, your PR will be reviewed (and hopefully approved!) by @alexren. If it's approved, then you'll get:
- All your electronic components
- A set of DSA keycaps
- 3 blank PCBs
- Your 3D printed/laser cut case
