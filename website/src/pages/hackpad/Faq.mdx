# Frequently Asked Questions

Welcome to the FAQ section! If you have something you think should be added here please ping @dari in the #hackpad channel

### The Card grant

**How much is the grant?** \
The grant is $20! This is because you also have to buy your PCB with the grant.

If you're from india, the grant is instead reduced to $10, however your PCB comes shipped from HQ!

**What can I do with the card grant?** \
You can get any custom parts you may need for your hackpad. The only requirement is that anying you buy MUST be something needed specifically for your design to function. I/O expanders, distance sensors, etc. are great! 

What's not great is trying to purchase the following:

- ENIG finishes
- USB cables / hubs
- Switch testers
- Extra rp2040s/switches/etc (either for another hackpad or project)
- Anything that won't be directly used for your one hackpad.

Hack Club is still a financially limited org and every bit of money we save on Hackpad goes to the next program.

I (alexren) added the grants because I want *all* of you to have as much creative freedom as possible. Please use it sparingly, otherweise my ability to provide them in the future will be limited

**When will grants be issued?** \
Around the first week of March

**What vendors are allowed?** \
No limit, but please link it to me in #hackpad before you make the purchase if it's not any of the following:
- AliExpress
- DigiKey
- LCSC
- JLCPCB

You need to have read this page to get the card grant. The password is "hackpadisthebestysws" - you will get an email asking for this password before your grant is issued.


### Everything else

**What gets shipped to me?**
- a soldering iron!
- a 3D printed case
- An unsoldered Seeed XIAO RP2040 with headers
- Any of the components requested from the [approved parts list](/parts)
- a $20 HCB grant. This will be used to cover **both** your **PCB** as well as any additional parts you may need! I/O expanders, random sensors, etc. It MUST be required for your SINGLE hackpad to be functional. No extras. You will need to upload receipts
    - USB C cables and USB hubs are not allowed.

**When is the deadline?** \
February 16th, 2025. This is the deadline for the macropad. The deadline for the keyboard is March 16th, 2025.

**Where can I find KiCAD footprints / what's the measurement for this thing / etc** \
A lot of these questions can be answered by checking out the [resources and tips section](/resources)! You can find **KiCAD footprints**, 3D models, etc

**Can I use a microcontroller other than the XIAO RP2040?** \
You can, however the following conditions apply:
- You need to fit all the parts for the MCU of choice + PCB in your $20 grant
- Your schematic + PCB is not going to be checked over - design at your own risk

The XIAO is a great primer and I recommend using it, but it's totally understandable if you want to do something more advanced! We won't stop you :)

**What's new with v2?** \
Lots of stuff! Updated list of requirements, more content, and other goodies - the big thing is that after making a macropad, you can design and submit an entire ***keyboard*** to be made!

**Do *I* have to make a macropad before making a keyboard?** \
Absolutely! A keyboard is *significantly* harder to design, and so its a prerequisite you understand the fundamentals with a macropad first. You don't need to wait for it to come though! You can start your keyboard as soon as its approved

**Will my hackpad come assembled?** \
Unfortunately not! Not to fear though - we'll send you a soldering iron, straight from HQ if you don't have one already.

**Can I use acrylic/cnc metal/etc for the case/plate?** \
NO!!! Only 3D prints are supported for the macropad. Keyboards are allowed to use acrylic, but CNC metal is still banned.

**Can I use parts outside of the approved list?** \
Yup! Put it in your $20 grant

**What colours are the keycaps?** \
We have red, black, and white keycaps at HQ. You can request what color specifically, but it's not guaranteed it'll be fulfilled. Sorry!

**Can I use Choc switches?** \
You can! We'll have V2's at HQ. note: please use 19.05x19.05mm spacing, or else the keycaps won't fit

**What are the footprint name for through hole diodes?** \
The footprint for 1N4148 Diodes are D_DO-35_SOD27_P7.62mm_Horizontal. These are the diodes we are using

**When are parts shipping / where are they shipped from?** \
Vermont, USA!

**When will they ship?** \
It'll be shipped from HQ the week of March break!

**When will PRs be reviewed??** \
Around the deadline!
