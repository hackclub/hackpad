# Frequently Asked Questions

Welcome to the FAQ section! If you have something you think should be added here please ping @dari in the #hackpad channel

**What's this Highway thing?** \
[Highway](https://highway.hackclub.com) is our current general hardware YSWS! Instead of being limited to just macropads, you can build any project you want! You can check out more about it [here](https://highway.hackclub.com/).

**What gets shipped to me?**
- An unsoldered Seeed XIAO RP2040 with headers
- A kit of all the parts in the approved parts list!
- a $15 HCB Card grant to get your **PCB** made
- a $18 HCB Card grant to get your soldering iron, if you need one. This is non-transferrable and fraud will result in a permanent ban from Hack Club.

{/* **What is the Card Grant?** \
[READ ME](/cardgrant) FOR INFO */}

**When is the deadline?** \
Same deadline as Highway! July 31st, but PLEASE don't hold it until then!

**Where can I find KiCAD footprints / what's the measurement for this thing / etc** \
A lot of these questions can be answered by checking out the [resources and tips section](/resources)! You can find **KiCAD footprints**, 3D models, etc

**Can I use a microcontroller other than the XIAO RP2040?** \
Sorry, no! If you want to use a different set of parts, you can make a custom project in [Highway](https://highway.hackclub.com), our current general hardware YSWS. You'll be given a $50 card grant instead to buy everything.

The XIAO is a great primer and I recommend using it, but it's totally understandable if you want to do something more advanced! We won't stop you :)

{/* **What's new with v2?** \
Lots of stuff! Updated list of requirements, more content, and other goodies - the big thing is that after making a macropad, you can design and submit an entire ***keyboard*** to be made! */}

{/* **Do *I* have to make a macropad before making a keyboard?** \
Absolutely! A keyboard is *significantly* harder to design, and so its a prerequisite you understand the fundamentals with a macropad first. You don't need to wait for it to come though! You can start your keyboard as soon as its approved */}

**Will my hackpad come assembled?** \
Unfortunately not! Not to fear though - assembling a 

**Can I use acrylic/cnc metal/etc for the case/plate?** \
NO!!! Only 3D prints are supported.

**Can I use parts outside of the approved list?** \
Yes! You are responsible for sourcing it on your own money though

**What colours are the keycaps?** \
White

**Can I use Choc switches?** \
No!

**What are the footprint name for through hole diodes?** \
The footprint for 1N4148 Diodes are D_DO-35_SOD27_P7.62mm_Horizontal. These are the diodes we are using

**Where will everything be shipped from?** \
It'll be shipped from HQ, which is located in Shelburne VT.
