# Frequently Asked Questions

Welcome to the FAQ section! If you have something you think should be added here please ping @dari in the #hackpad channel


**What gets shipped to me?**
- An unsoldered Seeed XIAO RP2040 with headers
- A kit of all the parts in the approved parts list!
- a $15 HCB Card grant to get your **PCB** made
- a $18 HCB Card grant to get your soldering iron, if you need one. This is non-transferrable and fraud will result in a permanent ban from Hack Club.

{/* **What is the Card Grant?** \
[READ ME](/cardgrant) FOR INFO */}

**When is the deadline?** \
February 16th, 2025. This is the deadline for the macropad. The deadline for the keyboard is March 16th, 2025.

**Where can I find KiCAD footprints / what's the measurement for this thing / etc** \
A lot of these questions can be answered by checking out the [resources and tips section](/resources)! You can find **KiCAD footprints**, 3D models, etc

**Can I use a microcontroller other than the XIAO RP2040?** \
You can, however the following conditions apply:
- You need to fit all the parts for the MCU of choice + PCB in your $20 grant
- Your schematic + PCB is not going to be checked over - design at your own risk

The XIAO is a great primer and I recommend using it, but it's totally understandable if you want to do something more advanced! We won't stop you :)

{/* **What's new with v2?** \
Lots of stuff! Updated list of requirements, more content, and other goodies - the big thing is that after making a macropad, you can design and submit an entire ***keyboard*** to be made! */}

{/* **Do *I* have to make a macropad before making a keyboard?** \
Absolutely! A keyboard is *significantly* harder to design, and so its a prerequisite you understand the fundamentals with a macropad first. You don't need to wait for it to come though! You can start your keyboard as soon as its approved */}

**Will my hackpad come assembled?** \
Unfortunately not! Not to fear though - we'll send you a soldering iron, straight from HQ if you don't have one already.

**Can I use acrylic/cnc metal/etc for the case/plate?** \
NO!!! Only 3D prints are supported for the macropad. Keyboards are allowed to use acrylic, but CNC metal is still banned.

**Can I use parts outside of the approved list?** \
No, sorry!

**What colours are the keycaps?** \
White

**Can I use Choc switches?** \
No!

**What are the footprint name for through hole diodes?** \
The footprint for 1N4148 Diodes are D_DO-35_SOD27_P7.62mm_Horizontal. These are the diodes we are using

**Where will everything be shipped from?** \
It'll be shipped from HQ if you're North American, otherwise from China!
