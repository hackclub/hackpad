## Ground Pour

Do you have too many neopixels? A ground pour is a good way to remove the need to route the GND traces, and would allow current a shorter return circuit.

Let's take this macropad for example:

<img src="/docs/v2/pourstart.png" className="max-w-96" />

You can see 4 neopixels and the OLED missing the ground traces. Thus we would like to add a ground pour. Click on the Add Filled Zone button on the right hand side:

<img src="/docs/v2/pouraddzone.png" className="max-w-96" />

Click on one corner of your board. You will get a new window, where you select GND in the middle, and check both F.Cu and B.Cu on the left side:

<img src="/docs/v2/pouradd.png" className="max-w-96" />

Click ok, and then draw the outline around your Edge.Cuts (It can be bigger then it, but then it won't be that pretty :P). When you have finished, press B to fill. You should press B each time you make a change so the fill can get updated (well not each time, but you get what I mean). The end result is like this:

<img src="/docs/v2/pourfilled.png" className="max-w-96" />

Oh no! Do you see the empty areas on the back of the board? Those are places where the ground pour can't reach. To fix this, you need to add some vias.

<img src="/docs/v2/pouraddvias.png" className="max-w-96" />

Click on that button, and place a few vias on the parts where the ground pour is missing (and feel free to put some even the in places where it isn't missing). And don't forget to press B again to refill! Your end product should look like this:

<img src="/docs/v2/pourfinish.png" className="max-w-96" />

<a name="matrix"/>
## Switch Matrix

[If you want, here is a detailed explenation of how key matrices works.](https://pcbheaven.com/wikipages/How_Key_Matrices_Works/)

Now you aren't satisfied with the number of keys you have? With switch matrices you can have more switches on less pins! (Wow this is a good sales pitch, hire me adafruit :3)

First, open up your schematic and place the switches in a grid shape:

<img src="/docs/v2/keymatrixschematic.png" className="max-w-96" />

If you want a non-symetric shape for your keys, it's fine to delete any switch you don't want.

Now add diodes. Their schematic name is `D`. Place them at one end of the switch (any end, but it should be the same for all the switches), **pointing away from the switch**:

<img src="/docs/v2/keymatrixschematicdiode.png" className="max-w-96" />

Now, connect each row of diode heads together to form a row, and connect the each row to a GPIO pin. Do the same with the each column of switches (on the side without the diode) to form a column. Connect each column to a GPIO pin too.

<img src="/docs/v2/keymatrixschematicconnected.png" className="max-w-96" />

Now you do the same things assigning the footprints, but for diodes you will use D_DO-35_SOD27_P7.62mm_Horizontal as the footprint.

<img src="/docs/v2/keymatrixschematicassign.png" className="max-w-96" />

Congrats! You got a working key matrix. Nothing really changed for the PCB routing part. Just as a side note, don't put the diodes directly on the switches (or they will collide in real life). I recommend putting them on the other side of the board (flip using F) and between the switches:

<img src="/docs/v2/keymatrixdiode.png" className="max-w-96" />

NOTE: When making the bom, write 1N4148 instead of diode

<a name="silkscreen"/>
## Silkscreen Art

Is your board too plain? Add some silkscreen art!

First, you need to find the art. The best resource is google of course. I recommend you find a picture with well defined lines, and a good color contrast. This is needed since we will only have two colors: black and white. (Not even gray).

PS. Find cute anime pics on pixiv.net UwU

I'm taking this image as a example:

<img src="/docs/v2/silkgura.png" className="max-w-96" />

Credit: https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/124874618

It has a good color contrast and well defined lines, which is perfect to use as silkscreen art.

Now that you have your art. Open up kicad and launch the image converter.

<img src="/docs/v2/silkconverter.png" className="max-w-96" />

Click the "Load Source Image" button on the right hand side and select your image, you should see something like thiis:

<img src="/docs/v2/silkbadsilk.png" className="max-w-96" />

As you can see, the image isn't that good. Now play with the "Black / white threshold" slider on the right, and maybe try ticking the "Negative" checkbox. You should be able to find a point where you are satisfied:

<img src="/docs/v2/silkgoodsilk.png" className="max-w-96" />

If you can't find a good point, try finding another image, or open up a paint program, and make the contrast stronger.

Now, at the bottom right, change the "Pcb Layer for Graphics" to "Front silk screen", and change the output format to "Footprint (.kicad_mod file)"

<img src="/docs/v2/silkoptions.png" className="max-w-96" />

Click on the "Export to Clipboard button", and go to your PCB editor. Click Control+V (Or Command+V on Macs), and place your silkscreen down. If your image is too small/big, try editing the size in "Output Size", and export to clipboard then paste again.

If there is a "G***" text in your silkscreen, just select it and press del (or right click and delete).

I placed mine on the back side of the PCB, and this is the final result:

<img src="/docs/v2/silkfinal.png" className="max-w-96" />
<img src="/docs/v2/silkfinal3d.png" className="max-w-96" />

Pretty right? UwU

## OLED
[Download this footprint library and unzip it](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcheyao%2Fmacropad%2Ftree%2Fmain%2FPCB%2Fthird_party%2FKiCad-SSD1306-128x64-master), then add it to kicad.

Open up the schematic editor. If you have anything connected on the pins named "GPIO6/SDA" or "GPIO7/SCL", move them to another pin. Then add the symbol named SSD1306. Be sure to not use the built in symbol!

Be sure to not use the built in footprint! The correct footprint should be called 128x64OLED:

<img src="/docs/v2/oledsymbol.png" className="max-w-96" />

Connect VCC to the +5V symbol, and GND to GND (Search these symbols using the P key). Then connect SDA to the SDA of the Xiao, and SCL to the SCL of the xiao.

<img src="/docs/v2/oledhalfschem.png" className="max-w-96" />

Now to the important part, you must add two pull-up resistors to the SCL and SDA lines. (What pull up means? It isn't really important but you can Google it)

Search for the symbol named `R` and place one on each SDA and SCL lines, and wire the other end of the resistors to a +3.3V symbol (Find it using P). Don't forget to add a +3.3V symbol to the Xiao!

<img src="/docs/v2/oledschem.png" className="max-w-96" />

NOTE: In your BOM, you need to specify that the resistors are 4.7kΩ.

Now you just need to associate the symbols to the footprint. Select R_Axial_DIN0204_L3.6mm_D1.6mm_P7.62mm_Horizontal for the resistors, and 128x64OLED for the oled. (**NOT** Adafruit_SSD1306!)

<img src="/docs/v2/oledassoc.png" className="max-w-128" />

If you want to use a 0.91" display, download this library and add it to the .pretty folder:
- [0.91" OLED Display](https://github.com/gorbachev/KiCad-SSD1306-0.91-OLED-4pin-128x32.pretty/blob/master/SSD1306-0.91-OLED-4pin-128x32.kicad_mod)
Then choose this footprint when associating.

Now continue to the PCB editors and route the pins! It isn't that different from routing the switches. I recommend placing the diodes on the back side of the OLED screen.

<a name="jumpers"/>
## Jumper Wire Holes

Do you want some jumper wire holes? You can create a split macropad, or have some components away from the PCB with this!

Just add the symbol named "Conn_01xNUM_Pin" to your schematic (Replace NUM by the number of pins you want).

Wire it up and associate the footprint SolderWire-0.1sqmm_1xNUM_P3.6mm_D0.4mm_OD1mm (Replace NUM by the number of pins you want)

<a name="rneopixels"/>
## Reverse Mount Neopixels

I highly recommend you to look into how to make [a ground pour](#ground) first.

To add reverse mounted neopixels, [download this footprint library and unzip it](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcheyao%2Fmacropad%2Ftree%2Fmain%2FPCB%2Fthird_party%2Fneopixel.petty). You need to use the built-in SK6812MINI symbol with it.

You already know how to wire neopixels from the general tutorial (aka DIN to DOUT, VDD to +5V and VSS to GND).

The only difference is that you need to assign SK6812MINI-E footprint to the neopixel

<img src="/docs/v2/neoassoc.png" className="max-w-96" />

You can put them anywhere as usual, but if you want to put them under your switches, follow this:

First, select the **center** of the neopixel, then move it to the **center** of the corresponding switch:

<img src="/docs/v2/neomiddle.png" className="max-w-96" />

Now click E, and enter +5.08 at the Y fiels on the bottom left

<img src="/docs/v2/neoedit.png" className="max-w-96" />

Click ok and you should see your neopixel move down. Now click F to flip it onto the other side. (They will be shining towards the top, since they are reverse mounted).

Repeate for all your leds, and you should be done!

<img src="/docs/v2/neofinal.png" className="max-w-96" />

NOTE: You shouldn't route inside the white border of the neopixel, since it will be drilled out. KiCAD should prevent you from doing it, but you will need to move any existing traces.

<a name="rotary_encoder"/>
## Rotary Encoder

So you want a rotating knob! Good idea!

First, add the symbol RotaryEncoder_Switch to your schematic.

<img src="/docs/v2/rotarysym.png" className="max-w-96" />

The right side of the symbol acts the same as a normal switch, you can just wire it into your key matrix/together with your switches. Connect the middle pin (C) to GND, then the top and bottom pins (A and B) to a GPIO pin:

<img src="/docs/v2/rotarywired.png" className="max-w-128" />

Now, you should associate the symbol to the RotaryEncoder_Alps_EC11E-Switch_Vertical_H20mm_CircularMountingHoles footprint.

After that, just route your PCB as normal.

<a name="expander"/>
## IO Expander

Not enough IO pins? Want to add like a ton of rotatory encoders?? It's time for an IO expander!

We are going to use the MCP23017 io expander chip. For the symbol select MCP23017_SO.

<img src="/docs/v2/expandersym.png" className="max-w-96" />

First, connect VDD to +3.3V and VSS to GND. The reset pin should also be connected to +3.3V. Connect A0, A1 adn A2 to GND.

Connect SDA to the SDA pin of the Xiao, and SCL to the SCL pin. You need to add pull-up resistors on SDA and SCL.

Search for the symbol named `R` and place one on each SDA and SCL lines, and wire the other end of the resistors to a +3.3V symbol (Find it using P). Don't forget to add a +3.3V symbol to the Xiao!

<img src="/docs/v2/expanderwired.png" className="max-w-128" />

NOTE: In your BOM, you need to specify that the resistors are 4.7kΩ.

Now you got 16 additional IO pins! (GPA0-7 and GPB0-7) Use them wisely :D

When associating the symbols to the footprint. Select R_Axial_DIN0204_L3.6mm_D1.6mm_P7.62mm_Horizontal for the resistors. The MCP23017_SO should already be pre-assigned, but it's corresponding footprint is SOIC-28W_7.5x17.9mm_P1.17mm.
