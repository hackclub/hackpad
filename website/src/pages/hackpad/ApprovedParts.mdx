- Choc V2 switches (Max 16x)

## Custom parts
Put this in your $20 grant!

The grant should be used ONLY for parts that directly go towards the *function* of your hackpad. This means cheapest shipping, no ENIG, no USB-C cables, etc. Hack Club is stil a financially constrained nonprofit and every bit of money we can save with Hackpad goes towards future programs.

I added the grant because I want to allow *all* of you to be as creative as possible, but if the grant gets unnecessarily spent then I'll have to limit parts again in the future.
