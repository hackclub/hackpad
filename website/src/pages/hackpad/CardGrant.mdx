# About the card grant

The card grant is a $20 VISA credit card from stripe that will be issued to you when your hackpad gets shipped.

When spending in mind that Hack Club is still a financially limited org; every bit of money we save on Hackpad goes to the next program!

Abuse, fraud, and general misuse will mean that I (dari) am able to do this less often in the future and your projects won't be as fun

**What can I do with it?** \
First and foremost, to get your PCB from JLCPCB (or SEEED studio if you're in india). Do not use PCBWAY unless it's cheaper.

You also can get any custom parts you may need for your hackpad. The only requirement is that anying you buy MUST be something needed specifically for your design to function. I/O expanders, distance sensors, etc. are great! 

What's not great is trying to purchase the following:

- ENIG finishes
- USB cables / hubs
- Switch testers
- Extra rp2040s/switches/etc (either for another hackpad or project)
- Anything that won't be directly used for your *one* hackpad.

**What vendors are allowed?** \
No limit, but please link it to me in #hackpad *before* you make the purchase if it's not any of the following:
- AliExpress
- DigiKey
- LCSC
- JLCPCB
- Seeed (PCB ONLY)

**Does I need to include shipping/taxes/etc?** \
Yup! Everything must fit within your $20 grant.

**Tips for different merchants:** \
- JLCPCB: The default shipping is super expensive, switching to global direct line should be roughly $1.5 for shipping.
    - If you're anywhere within the US or Canada I can guarantee this is an option. Most places in the EU + UK have similar option
- DigiKey/LCSC: Combine orders with a friend! Makes stuff cheaper
- AliExpress: do some digging, there's usually way cheaper options
- Amazon: Don't. It is almost always far cheaper to go with aliexpress.
