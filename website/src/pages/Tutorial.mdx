# Make your own macropad!

Hey! Want to make your own macropad but have absolutely no clue where to start? You found the right place!

This process is going to be broken into 3 parts:
1. PCB Design
2. Case Design 
3. Firmware

First, we're going to start with...

## Designing your PCB
For this guide we're going to be using [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/), which is an open source PCB designer tool.

To start, we're going to have to import the necessary footprints. For this tutorial, you only need 2 footprints:
- [Keyswitch footprints](https://github.com/ai03-2725/MX_V2)
- [XIAO RP2040 footprint](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/OPL_Kicad_Library) (use the SAMD21 footprint for now, it's identical in pinout)




## Create your case
This guide uses [Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal) for designing the case. You can use other software, but it may be harder to follow along!

Before we start designing, it's useful to familiarize yourself with the different types of [keyboard mounts](https://www.keyboard.university/200-courses/keyboard-mounting-styles-4lpp7)

It's a long process, but the gist of it is:

1. Sketch a rectangle the size of your PCB
2. Sketch a larger rectangle around the PCB
3. Extrude a box with the sketches
4. Cut a 3mm gap for the plate
5. Add mounting holes
6. Add eyecandy

This graphic serves as a good reference for dimensions (stolen from [The Keyboard Atelier](https://kbatelier.org/)):

## Build your firmware
This tutorial uses the [QMK firmware](https://qmk.fm/) project as firmware! You can find out how to port your keyboard here: \
