# NOT DONE YET, FINISHING WITHIN 24 HOURS

# Make your own macropad!

Hey! Want to make your own macropad but have absolutely no clue where to start? You found the right place! In this tutorial,
we're going to make this nifty little thing! .

This process is going to be broken into 3 parts:
1. PCB Design
2. Case Design 
3. Firmware

If anything is unclear, 9 times out of 10 you can usually google it! If you're still stuck, feel free to ask in #hackpad on the slack!

First, we're going to start with...

## Designing your PCB
For this guide we're going to be using [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/), which is an open source PCB designer tool.

To start, we're going to have to import the necessary footprints. For this guide, you only need 1 footprint!
- [XIAO RP2040 footprint](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/OPL_Kicad_Library) (use the SAMD21 footprint for now, it's identical in pinout)
Once you have the footprints, you can google to figure out how to install them!

### Drawing the schematic

The schematic of a PCB is what defines all the different connections of your PCB, so we're going to start with that!

First, open KiCad up KiCad and create a new project, then click  on the "Schematic Editor" button:
![Screenshot of button](docs/schematicbutton.png)

This should open up the schematic editor. Once you're in, press the A key on your keyboard. This should open up a menu where you can add add components. Search for the following and add them:
- Seeed XIAO SAMD21 (this is not the rp2040; the symbol is still valid though!)
- SW_Push (this will be our switch! copy this 3 times)

After, your schematic should look something like this:
<img src="docs/schematiclayoutnowire.png" className="max-w-96" />

Next, press the W key on your keyboard. This should make a green wire start to appear. Route your PCB like so:
<img src="/docs/routedschematic.png" className="max-w-96" />
(to get the GND symbol, press P and search for it!)

### Route the PCB

### Add decoration


## Create your case
This guide uses [Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal) for designing the case. You can use other software, but it may be harder to follow along!

Before we start designing, it's useful to familiarize yourself with the different types of [keyboard mounts](https://www.keyboard.university/200-courses/keyboard-mounting-styles-4lpp7).

It's a long process, but the gist of it is:

1. Sketch a rectangle the size of your PCB
2. Sketch a larger rectangle around the PCB
3. Extrude a box with the sketches
4. Cut a 3mm gap for the plate
5. Add mounting holes
6. Add eyecandy

## Build your firmware
This tutorial uses the [QMK firmware](https://qmk.fm/) project as firmware! You can find out how to port your keyboard here: \
