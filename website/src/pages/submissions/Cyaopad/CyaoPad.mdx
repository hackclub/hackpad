PS. there is a strict assembly order, dm me (`@Cyao` on slack) to know it

[x] I ran DRC and there are 0 errors

## CAD
Designed using FreeCAD! It was painful. Be glad you have the current guide, I spent 10+ hours figuring out how to do everything correctly (and even like this I still did stupid stuff).

Everything fits together with 4 m3 screws and bolts

## Firmware

I wrote the firmware using kmk, you can see it inside the repo. It can be used to control your mouse!

## Notes
Making the pad was fun ^.^ but I was just too paranoid that something would go wrong and made 15+ revisions lol. Ended up learning how to use OpenSCAD and FreeCAD.
