# Wang01

The Wang01 is a 16 key macropad with rotary encoder.

## Overview:
- PLA plastic 3D printed case
- EC11 Rotary encoder
- 4 keys

## CAD Model
The macropad fits together using 4 M3 bolts and heatset inserts.
It was made using OnShape!

## PCB:
Here is the PCB. It was made with love using KiCad! A silkscreen was made using Figma.

## Firmware:
The firmware was entirely built using [QMK](https://qmk.fm/).

- the rotary encoder allows user to scroll down a page
- the 16 keys are a numpad with a decimal key, four functions keys, and an enter key
- nothing happens when you press the rotary encoder yet

## BOM:
Everything you need!

- 16x Gateron Milky Yellow Switches
- 16x DSA Keycaps
- 4x M3x16mm SHCS bolts
- 16x 1N4148 DO-35 Diodes
- 1x EC11 Rotary encoder
- 1x Xiao RP2040
- 1x 3D printed case
- 1x PCB

## Fun facts

- the firmware worked as expected the first time (yesssss)
- the hole for the USB-C cable was lined up (yesssss)
- the case was slightly too short and the lid is not flush (noooooo)
- the holes for the heatsets were too small (nooooo)
