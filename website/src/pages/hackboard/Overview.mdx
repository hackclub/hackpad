# Overview

Welcome to the keyboard section of hackpad! This section isn't completely finished, but here's roughly how it'll work and what's different from the macropad portion:

## Eligibility
First, you MUST make a working macropad. No exceptions.

## Deadline
Tentatively, the deadline is March 16th if you're making a full-sized keyboard. This may be extended, but it's unlikely

## Guides
Currently, there is no official guide as I'm not done my example! Instead, i'll be hosting workshops throughout the period where we can all come together and spend nights building our keyboards together

Afterwards, I'll make a writeup for you to base yours off of.

## Approved parts
Instead of having a set list, the only requirements are:
- you use an Orpheus Pico as the main microcontroller. It's our in-house, drop-in replacement for the Raspberry Pi Pico.
- You use 3mm acrylic, 3D printed plastic, or both for the case. 

That's it! You can use any other custom parts you'd like - you'll be given a grant to get it.
