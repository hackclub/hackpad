# Overview

Welcome to the keyboard section of hackpad! This section isn't completely finished, but here's roughly how it'll work and what's different from the macropad portion:

## Eligibility
First, you must have an approved PR for a macropad. It's okay if it hasn't been delivered to you yet! Just make sure it's merged

## Deadline
Tentatively, the deadline is March 16th, but Feb 16th if you're only making a macropad. if you're making a full-sized keyboard. This may be extended, but it's unlikely

## Guides
Currently, there is no official guide as I'm not done my example! Instead, i'll be hosting workshops throughout the period where we can all come together and spend nights building our keyboards together

Afterwards, I'll make a writeup for you to base yours off of.

## Approved parts
Instead of having a set list, there are no required parts! Instead, you'll have limits on each part of your grant. All prices listed **include shipping**:

- **PCB:** No limit! It just needs to fall under the requirements in the [FAQ](/faq)
- **Switches:** You're limited to a max value of $0.50/switch, *including shipping*. This should give you a good amount of variety.
- **Fasteners (screws nuts etc):** $15
- **Keycaps:** $25 - won't get you a very good set, but should give you something manageable.
- **Stabilizers:** $20 - go get those TX AP, Durock, etc stabs! Your board should feel good
- **Any other parts:** pitch me first - this is for stuff like rubber gaskets, dampening foam, etc.

These are hard limits unless there's a very specific exception. **You cannot take a grant from one part and move it to another.**

For the **MCU**, you have 2 options:
- up to 2 Orpheus Picos (for split keyboards), our in-house, drop-in replacement for the Raspberry Pi Pico.
- up to $8 for any MCU you want, including parts off LCSC if you want to integrate it. No exceptions for splits. 

You can source microcontrollers yourself if the grant doesn't cover it but you want to design around something else

For the case, you can either use 3D printed PLA plastic, 3mm acrylic, or both!
