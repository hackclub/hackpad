# The Crossair
A Very Epicly Epic Keyboard _**WOAH**_!
![alt text](images/overview.png)
*I was too lazy to place all the switches if I need to lmk
## Inspiration
The layout of my keyboard was from my CORSAIR K55 RGB Pro, but I cut off the volume and keypad. And replaced the keys above the arrow keys with macros.
## Challenges
* Wiring this big of a project in KICad (soldering's gonna be a pain)
* Making the case, I tried to use the ai03 faceplate generator, but I realized the sizes weren't write so I did a bunch of measurements.
