# big-board

this is like a 60% keyboard i think?? maybe like 62%

i dont understand keyboard percentage sizing. anyway

## Challenges
* I had to learn OnShape bc its like the only cad software i could run
* this project has unfortunately made me dislike doing CAD
* first time actually putting effort into routing and using vias in KiCAD
* i used KMK for my hackpad, so i wanted to learn how to use QMK for the full keyboard

## BOM stuff
Everything (including shipping/links) should be in BOM.md, and the PCB pricing should be in img/jlc.png
