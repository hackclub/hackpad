# The Mirakeeb Walpole \
---
Now, you may ask yourself: 'why the hell does this exist?' and my answer would be: 'and why the hell not? I was bored.' The Walpole is a compact, cool, and multi-layered keyboard build to be simple to assemble, simple to modify, and just neat to use. (also, I didn't want to use stabs because this is the first keyboard i've designed and I don't know how to use them lol)
