This is a mechanical 60% keyboard with a rotary encoder. Designing the PCB was a challenge, because at first I had no idea how to make the matrix for the switches, but I eventually figured it out thanks to tutorials.

## Bill of Materials
- 1x Orpheus Pico
- 1x Rotary Encoder
- 62x Gateron KS-33 Low Profile 2.0 Red (2x 45 key set, each $14.80 + $5.67 for shipping (I'll donate the difference to HackClub for the rest of the switches in the set))
- Stabilizers
- Low Profile Keycaps
- 1x PCB
