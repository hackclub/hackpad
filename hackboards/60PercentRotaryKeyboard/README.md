This is a mechanical 60% keyboard with a rotary encoder. Designing the PCB was a challenge, because at first I had no idea how to make the matrix for the switches, but I eventually figured it out thanks to tutorials.

## Bill of Materials
- 1x Orpheus Pico
- 1x Rotary Encoder
- 62x Cherry MX Switches (Preferrably Low Profile)
- 1x PCB
