## Inspiration.
I wanted to create a Macropad thats bold, handy and simple. This design took me a while to finalise after several changes. 

## Challenges.
This was my first time working with circuits and PCBs, moreover my first time using Fusion360, took my a ton of articles, tutorials, google searches and uncountable questions on the slack to finally get done with this. Another challenge was the time crunch, I got to know about the ysws quite late and during my exams so that put me behind by a lot.

## Passenger Pad
This was my final pad, with 8x MX Keys, 1x Rotary Encoder, 1x '91 12x32 OLED, and the XIAO RP2040.
I went with the name 'Passenger' as just like a passenger sits along with us in our journey, helping us to its capabilities, this macropad does the same
