Jayden's Customizable Pad is a 12 key macropad with a rotary encoder + led diodes. It also uses KMK firmware.
The Customizable Pad was created for the Hack Club HackPadV2 YSWS and this is my first time designing something like this.


Purpose:
Really anything...
It was originally for a num pad, but then I decided that I wanted some other features, so it can be used for more than a number pad


CAD Model:
I had to spend over 3 hours and 3 complete restarts in order to get the hackpad to fit and be centered to the best of my ability. I tried to use the instructions, but eventually I just did the math. The design is pretty basic: a simple block case and a cover.

PCB:
I also spent a while on this because I didn't know how to wire properly. The wiring looks haywire + messy, but I think I did ok for this being my first time.

I didn't know how to start this YSWS so I spent the first 1-2 weeks trying to understand how to designa schematic, and now I have a better understanding... Had a lot of help though

*Note* My PCB is about 0.513mm over the limit, but I was informed that was ok, which is why one of the requirements was not checked off *Note*
