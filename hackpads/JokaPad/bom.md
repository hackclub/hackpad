## BOM:
- 16x Cherry MX switches (Preferably Mx Silver Speed. If it's not possible then Reds)
- 1x PCB
- 16x Through-hole 1N4148 Diodes
- If possible - See-through material, like acrylic in the transparent places on my case. If not then just skip it
- PCB color... I leave it to you, make it look awesome!
