# WilliamPrimePad

Its a 4 key macropad with two rotary encoders, that is designed to be small and simple. It relies on a SEEED rp2040 and KMK firmware

##Features:
-PLA 3d printed case
-2x EC11 rotary encoders
-4 keys

##CAD:
It should all fit together without any heatset inserts, only 4 M3x16mm screws that will self tap into the top peice

its made of 3 peices, a top peice,  a plate that holds the switches, and a bottom plate that covers the underside
im quite happy with how compacts the CAD all ends up being

## PCB:
I made it all in kicad , when i made it, it was one of my first projects in kicad i have since realised i probably should have added a ground plane

## BOM:
Here should be everything you need to make this hackpad

- 4x Cherry MX Switches
- 4x DSA Keycaps
- 4x M3x16mm SHCS Bolts
- 2x EC11 Rotary Encoder
- 2x knobs for EC11 Rotary Encoder
- 1x XIAO RP2040
- 1x Case (3 printed parts)

##Extra stuff
I dont need a solder iron as i allready have a functional one
I also have the ability to 3D print my own parts, so i can print my own case
