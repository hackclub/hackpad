# PegokuPad
This is my first Macropad. It has 16 switches, one being a rotary encoder. It uses KMK.

## Inspiration
I always wanted to do an Stream Deck-like device and when I found out I could do the HackPad I went all in. 
Wanted to have a keyboard with the ability to directly launch apps.

## Challenges
The hardest part was understanding how the Switch matrix works.
