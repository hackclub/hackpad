# WinPad

## My spin on the macropad idea
Whereas most macropads have a 3x3 layout, I wanted to make a 1x3 layout. This is because I wanted to make a pad that could fit on my very cluttered desk, without taking up too much space. I specifically did *not* want to make it wireless, as I wanted to keep the cost down, and I didn't want to have to worry about it being pushed of my desk if lost. I also wanted to make it as simple as possible, so I could make it in a couple of days.

## Challenges
I had a few challenges to overcome. The first is this was my second PCB I had ever made, and by far the most complex. The only other PCB I made is a simple USB-c to usb-a adapter I made for OnBoard. 
Another challenge was that I had never used Autodesk Fusion before, and I had to learn how to use it to make the case.
