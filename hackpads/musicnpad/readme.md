A 16 key modified numpad with a 32x128 OLED.

## Why?

I was frustrated completing math/science homework online, having to type in so many numbers. I designed this numpad to allow me to type numbers quickly, tab between input fields, and control music while I work.

## BOM:
- 1x PCB
- 16x MX Switches
- 16x through-hole diode
- 1x Speed XIAO RP2040
- 1x case top (3d printed)
- 1x case bottom (3d printed)\
- 2x 2.0u key stabilizer
- 1x 0.91in 128x32px I2C OLED display

## Hardest Challenge

I had experience with electronic circuits and CAD before, but I had never designed a circuit board. That presented a bit of a learning curve. I found myself becoming too much of a perfectionist with the PCB design. Everything was fairly straightforward until I got to compiling QMK, which took a bit of guesswork. Nothing was super difficult, just a lot of learning experiences.
