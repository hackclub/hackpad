# My hackpad

My hackpad has 1 rotary encoders, 9 switches and a 0.96 oled display. My inspiration for making it was wanting to make a real tangible product i could use in my everyday life. 
The hardest part of making this for me was desing the pcbs in kicad.

# Bill of Materials

- 1x Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040
- 10x Through-hole 1N4148 Diodes
- 9x Cherry MX Switches ( would prefer to have blue switches)
- 1x EC11 Encoders
- 2x SSD1306 0.96 inch OLED 4 pin (128x64) boards)
- knob for rotary encoder

Additionally,

- 4x M3 Screw (16mm, with nuts)
- 2 M3 screw ( 5mm screw with nuts)
- Black filament for the bottom case.
- Black arylic for the plate (if possible!)

  Thanks so much!
