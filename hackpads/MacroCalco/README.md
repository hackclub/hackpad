# macrocalco
A macropad that almost looks like a calculator

## Info
The main idea was to make a numpad like device that can also be used as a normal macropad with the press of a button (actually it's 2).

Most of the pad was made in 5 days while I was sick and since I had never used KiCad, Fusion or QMK (not hard to notice tbh), most of the time was passed fighting the tools since I had no idea how to do stuff.

### Case
The top part will hold the switches, the bottom screws into the top (though the pcb) to keep everything safe
