## Inspiration:
I was a macropad that I could use for rhythm games and also for 3d enviroments, while also still having options incase I wanted to make my macropad a makeshift launchpad for music.

## Challenges:
~~Me being a dumbass~~ Honestly it was just me making everything harder that it was supposed to be. In, hindsight, making my macropad was actually pretty easy(-ish)

## Stuff:
- Simple design (Sleek!)
- Has an OLED (Cool!)
- KMK built with hopes and dreams as this is my first time doing this whole building a macropad thing (I really hope this works)
- Yeag! (Yeag!)
