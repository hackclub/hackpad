# meowpad
this is my submission for hackclub's hackpadv2 ysws.

i used kicad for the pcb, bricscad for the case, and kmk for the firmware

# inspiration
i saw the announcement talking about this ysws, and i thought it would be a great opportunity to learn 3d modelling and making pcbs  

# challenges
i had completely no exprience in making pcbs, or 3d models, so i was very confused by the software at the start.  
the fact that fusion360 was not available on linux, so i had to keep rebooting between macos and linux when i forget to get measurements was tough and demotivating  
(i dual boot linux and macos on my mac, and i barely had enough space for fusion360, so i couldnt install xicad on the macos partition)  
[my friend](https://github.com/uplre) saw me doing this and also wanted to start, so we ended up doing it together :3
