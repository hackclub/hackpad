# DinoPad

My inspiration to make this:
The portable, ergonomic dinosaur themed macropad, designed specifically for my problematic habits, not being able to press the screenshot key in time while gaming to clip something important.

# BOM:
- 5x Cherry MX Switches
- 1x EC11 Encoder Switch
- 1x SSD1036 OLED 128x64 0.96"
- 6x Through-hole 1N4148 Diodes
- 1x PCB

3d printed parts colour: White

The hardest challenge I faced whilst building this was time constraint, because I only found out about this 5 days before the YSWS ended. But it was really fun, figuring out how to use software by myself because of a not-so descriptive website guide, and it has taught me a lot about PCB design and how to learn independently!
