### Inspiration

The inspiration remained from v1. It was my first PCB design, naturally, I messed up and couldn't get the macropad. So here's my entry for v2. Design is mostly similar with 12 keys and a xiao. Silkscreen was changed tho. Looks much better.

### Challenges

To be honest, it wasn't a challenge. The challenge was my first entry during v1. I messed up so many times and DRC kept throwing me off. So this time around, I changed to EasyEDA from KiCAD which imo is way cleaner for beginners. However, one thing I definitely struggled with was imprting the pcb 3D model into tinker for reference. Reducing the file size while keeping the model intact and useful enough is rather complicated.
