# !!! Warning: RMK uses last 2 sectors of your microcontroller's flash by default. You have to ensure that those flash space is not used.
# If you're using a bootloader which puts itself at the end of the flast, like Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader, RMK will break the bootloader.
# Setting the `start_addr` manually to avoid this. See: https://haobogu.github.io/rmk/storage.html
