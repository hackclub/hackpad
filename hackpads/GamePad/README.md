# GamePad

# BOM:
- 8x Gateron Milky Yellows Cherry MX Switches
- 1x EC11 Encoder
- 1x 3D printed knob
- 1x PCB (blue)
- 9x Through-hole 1N4148 Diodes
- 1x 0.96 inch OLED (SSD1306)
- 4x female header pins (Possibly optional depending on tolerances)
- 1x M3x12 SHCS
- 4x M3x16 SHCS
- 5x M3 threaded inserts
- 1x Laser cut acrylic plate
- 8x WS2812Bs (Read Notes)

# Aesthetics:
Ideally:
- `Top plate` would be a light blue (Prusament: Azure Blue)
- `Midlayer` would be a light blue (Prusament: Azure Blue)
- `Base plate` would be a dark blue (Prusament: Pearl/Navy Blue)
- `Volume Knob` would be a dark blue (Prusament: Pearl/Navy Blue)
- `Keycap plate` would be frosted (if not transparent)
- `M3 screws` would be hex head screws
- `OLED screen` would have a white screen, and if not then blue
- `PCB` would be blue

# Notes:
- For the WS2812Bs, I do not know how to solder these yet - but I am planning to learn and then build a v2 hackpad. However as I don't know how to currently, and the other components are THT, Having this hackpad soldered with the LEDs seperate would be ideal :)
