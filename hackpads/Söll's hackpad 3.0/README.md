# Hackpad

## Problems:

- Code is very difficult without the hackpad
 

## Ideas:

- make it like in the style of my keyboard
 

## Features:

- 2 rotary encoders
- 12 normal switches (switch matrix)
- 12 LED's under the switches 
- an Oled-Display
- XIAO-RP2040-DIP
- IQ-Expander

   **everything possible in black please**

## Case:

- like my keyboard
- Plug-in system
 


## *IMPORTANT:*

- every possible in black (for example the      case or the switches)
- code isn't completely ready yet, but with      my Hackpad I will fix it
- please check if my case is only 10*10cm       because I made it with Blender and             sometimes there happens some Mistakes

This is my case. It's a plug-in system becase I think that's better and
'cleaner' for me.

This is my PCB.
