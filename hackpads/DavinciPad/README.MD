# DavinciPad-Caelum
"The inspiration for creating this came from my editing software, DaVinci Resolve. It is based on an existing keyboard designed by Blackmagic, the company behind DaVinci Resolve. I think the most challenging part for me was learning and understanding new software tools, such as KiCad and VSCode.

I would like to express my gratitude to my club leaders for guiding me through the process and 'holding my hand throughout the journey.' Thank you for this amazing opportunity!"
