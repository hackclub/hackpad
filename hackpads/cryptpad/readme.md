# cryptpad ☆.ᐟ
[cryptpad](https://github.com/arsoninstigator/cryptpad) is my submission for the hack club ysws "hackpad" where i had a lot of fun brainstorming by making rough sketches with ideas, planning the layouts, making a schematic, making a pcb based on the schematic, designing a printable case design on cad software and writing my own firmware.

> the pcb was made in kicad 8.99, the case was made in fusion and the firmware was written in kmk

## building process
### inspiration
my idea for the name of the project, the coffin shaped case and the overall dark gothic theme of my macropad was largely inspired by an innate need to be edgy and a [monster high phone case](https://github.com/arsoninstigator/cryptpad/blob/main/progress.md) i saw on etsy :3 i wanted my macropad to be a pastel goth draculaura (i have the same hair as her btw) themed combination of shortcuts that are most useful to me while i was working / relaxing on my computer

### challenges
the most challenging part was finding the time to revamp the project from scratch again and again since i had some difficulty narrowing down which components i wanted to use and what i wanted my layout to look like. i have SO many hobbies and interests so it was hard for me to pick an aesthetic (im currently revamping this project yet again) and each time i created a new board, i started grasping some additional pcb/cad concepts, making me want to include even more advanced changes to my board :3 i had to decide between a horror/gothic-y theme, a cute cat theme, a pastel theme, a detective/noir film theme and a pop-culture inspired theme. i wanted it to be consistent with my current vibes, interface with my current bedroom layout and be more neutral themed so i could even use it after the trends changed without being more queer/sapphic-y (that would out me) or more tech-y (boooo nerd !!!)
