# MacroVerse

## Overview
Macroverse is supposed to bea multipurpose macropad in order to perform many utility functions, alongside aiding with making keyboard shortcuts faster to execute.


The Macroverse features three modes

Normal - Behaves like a normal macropad

Utility - Containes utility functions(currently a stopwatch)

Game - A mode to keep you entertained(currently tic-tac-toe)

## Inspiration
A lot of times, when working on projects, or in general, I will have a need to use utilities, such as stopwatch, timer, RNG, etc.

This is what inspired the subsequent parts of this macropad.

## Challenges
Before this, I haven't really ever worked on something which requires interacting with hardware, or creating a case. This was a learning opportunity for me, and it was fun creating the PCB.
