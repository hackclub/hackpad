# ThinkPad

A ThinkPad themed macropad.

The case (and spacers) should be printed in black filiment.

The PCB should be black.

If possible it would be nice to get 16 black keycaps.

Clear switches would be nice.

I can solder and put everything together myself so assembely is not required.

I did not have enough time to put together the firmware so only the screen, rgb and rotary encoder is implemented, I have not figured out the io expander yet.

## BOM:
 - 1x PCB
 - 1x case (3d printed)
 - 1x top plate (laser cut acrylic)
 - 4x spacers (3d printed)

 - 1x EC11 rotary encoder
 - 16x SK6812-E LEDs
 - 1x ssd1306 0.96 inch oled
 - 1x piezo buzzer: something like this [https://www.adafruit.com/product/160](https://www.adafruit.com/product/160)
 - 17x Through-hole 1N4148 Diodes
 - 2x THT DIN0204 10KÎ© resistor
 - 16x MX switches (clear?)
 - 1x red 3mm led: like this [https://www.adafruit.com/product/777](https://www.adafruit.com/product/777)
 - 1x 1x10 header pins for debugging
 - 1x PCF8574A THT io expander
 - 4x m3 heatset inserts
