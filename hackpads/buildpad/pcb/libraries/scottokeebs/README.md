ScottoKeebs at its core is an extensive collection of freely available handwired keyboard and macropad projects. It was started in September of 2022 and since then over 19 projects have been released. Most of them fit on a common 220x220mm 3D printer, require minimal support material, and use either an Arduino Pro Micro or a more powerful Raspberry Pi Pico.

# Supporting

The ScottoKeebs project is released entirely for free and always will be, however, the development of new boards is completely out of my own pocket. Itâ€™s not a particularly expensive project to maintain but does involve quite a bit of time between prototyping and making content related to them.
