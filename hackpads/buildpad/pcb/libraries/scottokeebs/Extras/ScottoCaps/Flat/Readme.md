# ScottoCaps (Flat)

Low-profile flat Cherry MX keycaps designed for FDM 3D printing. I recommend using the "Fuzzy Skin" setting in Cura for a cleaner look in addition to using a [textured PEI build plate](https://amzn.to/43r18ka). Also, keep in mind that using matte filament will likely make the stem fragile. It is possible to use them with fragile stems because normal use doesn't put too much off-axis force but just be aware that you might need extras. If you are having a very hard time getting the stems to print, increase your temperature to help the layer adhere to one another.

# Rotation Issue

One large issue is that most keycaps will be rotated clockwise about 1 degree which makes them look odd on a keyboard. To hopefully counteract this, all single-mount keycaps are rotated counterclockwise **0.625 degrees**. This number is a rough average that I've gotten based on community feedback and my own testing on 5 different printers. It is close but you may have to manually modify them to get a rotation that works for your machine. You can also mirror the keycap in your slicer if you have counterclockwise rotation.

Stabilized keys don't typically face this issue since they have multiple mounting points to keep them aligned. It's also counterintuitive because to get a counterclockwise rotation, you need to rotate the keycap body clockwise since you're looking at it from the back.

# Stems

The stems are designed based on a tolerance of ~0.15mm, your printer may or may not be capable of handling this. If your keycaps are too tight, you can use some hot water to make the plastic more pliable when installing them. If they are too loose, you can cut [Kapton tape](https://amzn.to/45GeFFr) and use it between the keycap and switch to improve the fit.

**Don't force them onto your switches as if they're too tight, it will be very hard to get them off.**
