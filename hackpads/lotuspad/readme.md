# MacroPad-Lotus

![pad](https://i.imgur.com/oIopzex.png)

The inspiration for creating this macropad came from my love for coding and the need for efficient shortcuts while programming. It is designed to enhance productivity by providing quick access to frequently used commands and macros. The process of designing this project taught me a lot about using new tools like Fusion 360 and KiCad. It was also the most difficult part in the process. I think Fusion360 has a very steep learning curve.


## Bill of Materials

- 9x Cherry MX-style keyswitches (preferably tactiles)
- 9x 1N4148 Diodes
- 1x 0.96 inch SSD1306 OLED Display
- 9x DSA Keycaps (preferably white)
- 4x Heatset inserts
- 4x M3x16 screws
- 4x M3 hex nuts
- 1x XIAO RP2040

## Usage

This macropad is designed for developers and coders who rely heavily on keyboard shortcuts. The programmable keys and rotary encoders can be customized for:
- Code formatting and navigation.
- Running scripts or compiling code.
- Custom code snippets.
