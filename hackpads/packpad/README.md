# j4y_boi's *PackPad*!  
This is my very own hackpad, crafted from the depths of *my laptop*  
I quite enjoyed this YSWS because of the new things I learnt to do!
One of the problems I did face was Fusion 360 acting up, that slowed down progress a lot, and I hope it didn't cause irreperable harm to my model...
I took inspiration of macropads I found online, but changed up the layout a little.
