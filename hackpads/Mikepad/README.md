## MikePad
Welcome to my Hackpad section! This is my first Hackpad. It made me so passionate about electronics and
want to share the challenges I've faced with you all.

### PCB
First of all, the Process Control Block took me hours to get done. I really recommend following
Joe Scotto's tutorials for it.

### Case
The case was designed to be 3D printed. The most difficult thing was to learn how to use Fusion360.
At first, it could be seen has an hard, over-complex program but I can't thank me enough for not
giving up. Don't give up!

### Firmware
This took me a while to get started, there weren't as many tutorial as for the other parts but
I still had a great introspection into it. 

### Conclusions
I loved working on this idea and project, I can't thank you enough for making me part of this!

### Bill of Materials (BOM)
- 9x Cherry MX Switches (I'd prefer them to be white cream)
- 1x Seeed XIAO RP2040
- 1x 0.91in 128x32px OLED
- 1x PCBs (Even more if possible, please)
- 1x Bottom case (3D Printed, black matte)
- 1x Top plate (3D Printed, black matte)
- 4x M3x20mm screws 
- 3x EC11 Encoder
- 9x Through-hole 1N4148 Diodes
