# MyHackPad

I tried making a macropad. it was my first time making a PCB, designing a case and writing firmware! The pcb looks nice and the case works however, i had some trouble with the firmware. the kmk hopefully works but qmk could not pass the lint check.


it is a 3x3 macropad with an encoder and 4 neopixels
BOM:
8x MX-Style switches
8x Through-hole 1N4148 Diodes
8x Blank DSA keycaps(any color)
1x EC11 Rotary encode
4x SK6812 MINI-E LEDs
4x M3x16mm screws
4x M3 hex nuts
3D printed case(any color)

here are some pictures!
