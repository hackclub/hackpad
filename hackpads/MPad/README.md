## MPad

A simple macropad. It uses matrix wiring for switches, and a rotary encoder. I used KMK to make the firmware as I mainly use python for my other projects.

I want the case to be 3d printed in all white if possible. Also, if possible, make the pcb black in color.

The BOM is [here](pcb/BOM.md)
