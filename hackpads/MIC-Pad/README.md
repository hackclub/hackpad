# Military  Industrial Complex Pad
First time making anything w/pcbs, so this was a learning experience. I'm not sure if I'll ever make another one, but I'm glad I did it. The biggest struggle was working with CAD software in general ( Using Shapr3D ) and I spent wayyy too much time creating the 8 screw holes needed for the case.

# About
This is a 5x4 numpad with a 128x32 OLED display.

# Notes
This is a 150mm long PCB which is outside the 100mm limit for the pcb. But I'm grandfathered in because I made the PCB before the 100mm limit was put in place. (Check the slack! @blahajfromikea)
