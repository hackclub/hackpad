### Inspiration

I wanted to boost my productivity and add an aesthetic looking device to my desk setup.

### Challenges

Believe it or not, this was my first time using Fusion 360! I spammed ChatGPT and #hackpad with queries. It also took me a lotta time making the PCB and routing it 😭. I had to reroute a hundred times.
