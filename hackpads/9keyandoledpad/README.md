# Macropad with 9 keys and an OLED

This macropad was lightly themed after Sumeru from Genshin Impact
This is my first PCB and CAD so I decided to keep it simple.
The measurements for the placements of the parts were made with the very scientific method of eyeballing it so it might or might not fit ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
