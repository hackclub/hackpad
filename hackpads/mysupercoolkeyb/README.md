## something

As I have much experience working in fusion 360, the CAD design for the case came easily to me; however working on the PCB in kicad was an entirely new experience to me, I do intend to design a split keyboard in future, and this definetly helped me get closer to that goal, funded by my dad for christmas. Working with firmware for the keyboard was also a new experience for me. Hack Club has been a really helpful in getting me out of my comfort zone, it's been a while since I've started a new project in a new software.
