I was inspired by myself, as i created the design along the way. This is the first PCB ive ever made, and am pround of it. One challenge i have overcome is my procrastination, which has pushed writing this readme and making the firmware to tthe deadline. <br/>
BOM: <br/>
1x EC11E Rotary encoder with switch <br/>
12x cherry mx switches (the ones linked in the guide)<br/>
12x 1N148 diodes <br/>
1x XIAO DIP SMD <br/>
3x 3d printed parts (top case, bottom case, rotary encoder cap)
