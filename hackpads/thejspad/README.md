## Inspiration
I've seen lots of other people on YouTube creating macropads and I've always wanted to do pcb design. So once I saw that hackpad was a thing I joined (second time around). But I kinda just threw the components on the pcb and it worked :D
## Challenges
* First time **EVER** using KiCad or doing anytype of PCB design
* Not being able to test firmware (so it _may_ work idk)
* Assembling everything in CAD, while I have done CAD before I use Onshape not Fusion so I had to adapt to that but also I've never done assemblies so this was a first.
## Specifications
### BOM
- 4x Cherry MX Switches
- XIAO rp2040
- Keycaps (idk the type just what ever works)
- 2x M3x16 Bolt
- 2x M3 Heatset
### Other
- pcb (duh)
- case
