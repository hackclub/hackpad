# spypad

If possible, I want the third part (the case for the bottom (white in the design)) to be transparent/translucent filament

I would also like the rotary encoder caps and the text to be white

The frame can be any colour, you can use your filament scraps since that part won't be seen

If possible, I would also like the main case (The top) to be black.

Hopefully this will be possible? 

Thanks
