# CAD-PAD
This is a macropad that I am making because I think that it would be cool if I hade a keypad that had the buttons in the shape of my hand, so I took measurements for that, and I modeled around that. I also tried to make this to help me with 3d modeling, with having some of the functions on one keypad

These are renderings of my Macropad.

## CAD Model
I made my case in fusion 360. It is just made out of a base and a lid which would be held together by 4 M3 screws and heatset insets. I will probably just tape the PCB to the base, but maybe I will come up something better.

## PCB
I made the PCB in KiCAD< and was my first time designing one, so the routing is a little bit messed up. I took the image on the PCB From google.

This is my Schematic

This is my PCB.
## My Firmware
This is just something really simple, and will probably make it better later.
