## Inspiration
I am in robotics at my high school and I work mostly on the mechanical of the team's robot. However, I've been wanting for a while to get into the electrical aspect and I saw this as a fun opportunity to get some experience soldering and making PCBs to hopefully understand more!

## Challenges
The firmware was my biggest challenge, it was hard to figure out where to start or what to do. I might have to change a lot of stuff in the code once I get my hackpad, but I will keep at it and keep trying to make it work!

## BOM
 - 1x XIAO RP2040
 - 16x Cherry MX Switches
 - 2x SK6812 MINI Leds
 - 16x Blank DSA Keycaps
 - 4x M3x16 Bolt
 - 4x M3 Heatset
 - 16x THT Diodes..? (I followed the key matrix tutorial, so I used that one)

## Other
 - KMK Firmware
 - PyroProtato Macropad Top.stl
 - PyroProtato Macropad Bottom.stl
 - Custom PCB
