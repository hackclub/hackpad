This is the first PCB I ever made! I had some trouble with the case but I think it's correct now.

It's designed to help with coding as it has buttons for common tasks.
The rotary encoder changes the selected programming language which is displayed on the OLED screen. The language changes the top row to input some commonly used code.  
The bottom row does Undo, Copy, Paste and puts a semicolon (The first 3 sadly work on linux only)

## Notes
- Please use LeadFree HASL surface finish in jlcpcb (not HASL with lead)
- Preferred PCB color: Black
- Preferred case color: Dark Blue (like the bottom, third from the left, as seen in the slack photo)

## BOM:
- 1x THT Seeduino Xiao RP2040
- 8x Cherry MX switches
- 1x EC11 Encoder
- 1x SDD1306 OLED Panel 128x32
- 4x Case screws (2.9mm diameter)
- 9x THT 1N4148 Diodes
