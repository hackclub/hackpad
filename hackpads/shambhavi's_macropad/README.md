# midi macropad :)
the (push switch) keys play the (musical) key's tonic triad notes; <br> turning the rotary encoder changes the key of the notes; <br> the OLED display shows what key you're in.<br><br>i need all the parts soldered, thank you!


### inspiration 
i wanted to be able to make music more intuitively and easily than simply using a traditional mouse and keyboard setup.

### hardest challenges
- learning to use fusion360 ðŸ˜§
- learning what all these new words meant (use a matrix? configure the keyboard?? compile the code?!)

### fun facts!
when i get the hackpad, i'll probably try to code the OLED display and rotary encoder to act as a metronome :D

# BOM:
- 1x Seeed XIAO RP2040 through-hole (preferably black, otherwise green)
- 1x 0.91 inch OLED Display
- 3x MX-Style switches
- 1x EC11 Rotary Encoder
- 1x PCB
- 3x Blank DSA keycaps
- 1x case (preferably lime green! otherwise any green or black)
