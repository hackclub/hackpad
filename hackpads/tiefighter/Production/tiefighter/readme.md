Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make tiefighter:default
    
Enter the bootloader 2 ways:
    * **Physical reset button**: Briefly press the button on the back of the PCB - some may have pads you must short instead, typically RST and GND connected with tweezers.
    * **Keycode in layout**: Press the key mapped to `QK_BOOT` if it is available
