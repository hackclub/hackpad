## Inspiration

The idea of this macropad is to be an audio controller which has toggles for different applications. It's in the form of a tiefighter to give it some fun character. I was originally going for a control panel like on a plane, but needed something flat since I didn't want to get things too complicated. The buttons on the side still allow for easy access while being out of the way of the toggle switches.
