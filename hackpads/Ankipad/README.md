# Ankipad
_10-key macropad designed for Anki revision._

### For reference...
[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is an active recall revision software, if you haven't heard of it how have you been revising until now? This macropad will bring you a ***STEP*** (cough cough) closer to acing your next Anki study session.

## Inspiration

I picked this project because I didn't like my current Anki keyboard setup, which made revising SUPER hard. But then, with basically no experience in PCB design or CAD, I learned how to use KiCad, FreeCAD and met some cool people on ```#hackpad```. I wrangled with FreeCAD for sooo long, and watched so many YouTube tutorials, most of all ScottoKeebs, but in the end I'm happy with how it turned out.

I put doing this off for a while, so I didn't get time to add some of the other features I wanted like rotary encoders and OLED screens. But maybe if Hackpad V3 comes...?
