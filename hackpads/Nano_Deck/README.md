# BOM:

- 14x Cherry MX switches (Gateron Milky Yellows because they are available at HQ)
- 2x EC11 Rotary Encoders with Switch
- 1x PCB
- 16x Through-hole 1N4148 Diodes
- 16x SK6812MINI LEDs (unsoldered - approved by Alex)
- 1x Seeed XIAO RP2040 (through hole)
- 1x 0.96 inch OLED display
- 28x Mill-Max 0305s (I haven't included them in the PCB as they can be soldered on the MX switch pins without any modification - 2 sockets are required for each switch so 28)
- 1x PCF8574A IO expander (approved by Alex)
- 2x 4.7 kΩ resistors (through hole)
- 14x Keycaps (Can I get them in the same color scheme as the picture? Or something similar?)
- 4x M3 heat-inserts (Just like the ones used in the Orpheuspad! I think they're M3xD4.6xL4.)
- 4x M3 screws, 25mm long (Screw length: 25mm, diameter: 3.4mm. I have left 6mm space for the screw heads. <br>
  I’ve left 3.4mm diameter holes for them, and 6mm for the tops to fit snugly. <br>
  I have made a slanted base just like Orpheuspad! The total case height is 30mm at the taller end, where the heat insert goes from 26mm to 30mm, and 25mm at the lower part, with inserts from 21mm to 25mm. I’ve also lowered the screw top area at the taller end (like the Orpheuspad), so everything fits perfectly!)

## 3d Prints (Black filament like in the picture, please!):

- 1x Case Top upper
- 1x Case Top lower
- 1x Case Main Body
- 1x Case Main Body bottom (spacer)
- 1x Case Bottom
- 2x Rotary Encoders Tops

## Laser Cut (Acrylic Plate):

- 1x Key Plate
