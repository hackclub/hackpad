## Inspiration 
I wanted to create a macropad to gift for someone, and I created this useful hackpad to help save time with macros. I created a macropad using 8 switches, 1 RP2040, 2 LEDs, and 1 OLED display.

## Challenges
I had never done anything like this before. My experience was only in coding stuff; I've never modeled something in 3D nor created a custom PCB. I struggled at first, but I eventually came to this creation.
