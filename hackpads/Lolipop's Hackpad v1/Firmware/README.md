# Firmware for Lolipop's Hackpad

This firmware runs on KMK!

Note that this firmware is not the final version as I couldn't test it on my hardware. Therefore, it may contain bugs. It's quite hard to project the final features and code without the actual hardware. The macros, keys, and OLED display content are subject to change once I have the hardware for testing.
