# TYRANNOJ PROJEKT2  
This is my first PCB, just want to play around with it. My firmware is not fully optimized due to a lack of time, I will optimize it when the parts get shipped. My libraries in the pcb part are zipped, so I could upload everything, you have to unzip them or else the pcb won't work
