# Spacepad

**Project Description:**  
Spacepad is a macropad consisting of 12 keybinds that can boost your productivity to the moon! With custom keybinds,
you do not need to worry about complicated key shortcuts.

**inspiration and Challenges**
I was always interested in hardware but didn't really have a chance to dive in yet. And this was a great chance to start.
In addition, some challenges I had were just changing pcb errors and trying to add Firmware.
