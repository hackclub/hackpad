# The Hackmacro
A 4x4 ortho macro pad with 1 rotary encoder powered by the Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040 and Vial, a fork of QMK. Heavily inspired by the [Work Louder x Figma Creator Micro](https://worklouder.cc/figma/).

The Creator Micro has such an amazing design that I couldn't resist taking inspiration from it. 

In attempting to mimic the Creator Micro, for the PC shell, I used a white plastic shell with a top layer of 3mm acrylic where the NeoPixels can hopefully shine through.

One of the most notable things about the Creator Micro is that it has no plate and is practically just the PCB on top of the shell. I incorporated this design feature into my macro pad as well.

### A Challenge I Faced:
- Because of the Kalih Choc V1 & V2 sockets I put on my PCB, I could not find a space-efficient spot to place the XIAO RP2040 microcontroller.
> My solution to this was simply extended the pcb, unfortunately making it no longer a square just like the Creator Micro. I did end up with space for silkscreens though.
