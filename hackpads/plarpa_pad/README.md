PLARPA PAD

Simple very four botton meant to hand held and press

Put in hand and use four top fingers excluding thumb to press them, for any reason or purpose

My first experience doing the digital P C B design

Very fun to make and attempt, maybe I will do keyboard too to learn more

Challenge was Using kicad and the library, but Slack helpful very often
