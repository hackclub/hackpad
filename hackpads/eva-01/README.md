# EVA-01

## Overview

I'm Joseph, and this is my Macropad! The EVA-01. It features 14 inputs, has 12 switches, one knob, and an OLED display! I will be using this for coding and cad work! I know this pcb is over the limit; however, I can pay for the board myself, I love this layout and wouldn't want to see it go away!

I would like to solder it myself!
## About
