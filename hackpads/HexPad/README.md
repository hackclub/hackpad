# HexPad

On the outside, this looks like a simple macropad, but the insides are what makes this macropad special.

Built during Hack Club's HackPad event, I designed this macropad to be as customisable as possible. The firmware for the HexPad is written in well-commented Python, and is really simple to understand. The case design is also simplistic, and can be easily 3D printed and modified using CAD software.

While making this macropad, the toughest challenge was learning PCB design, and OnShape, as I usually use Tinkercad. I took this as an opportunity to learn something new, and I'm glad I did. I learnt a lot about PCB design and I feel a lot more comfortable navigating OnShape!

Next Steps: Sadly, I didn't have enough time to add some features I would have liked to add, but after the HexPad gets shipped, I plan on adding a virtual pet using the OLED display + multiple layers. Another distant ambition is to make a GUI application that allows you to customise the HexPad to your liking without messing around with the firmware.
