# dldpad
This is my hackpad, named dldpad because I am bad at names. I've worked on a decent number of PCB, Arduino, and 3D modeling projects, but this is probably the most complex I've worked on. The PCB design was relatively simple, but the case and the firmware were anything but. I had to go through 3 different modeling softwares in order to be able to model the case, and my laptop decided it didn't like me, so I had to make and build my QMK firmware on Nest. But all in all, this was a great and fun project, and I'm glad to have done it!

> For some reason, I couldn't find a model for the display, so that's not shown in the render. I also for some reason forgot to put keycaps in the render but I'm about to go to bed the day this is due and I'm too tired to bother with it right now.

I've assigned the keys to function keys so that I can hook them up to most likely sound effects in Voicemod, and the encoder is volume control. The OLED doesn't do very much yet, but that's just because I can't figure out how to make bitmaps for it right now.

## BOM
- 1x Seeed XIAO RP2040
- 6x Cherry MX switch (If I get to choose, red switches, but it doesn't really matter)
- 1x EC11 Encoder
- 1x 0.91" 128*32 OLED Display
- 6x Keycaps
- 4x M3*16 bolts
- 4x M3 heatset inserts
- *The case will be printed by me!*
