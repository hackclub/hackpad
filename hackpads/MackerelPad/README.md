# Mackerel Pad

First ever Marco pad! I just did a 3x3 grid using diodes to keep things somewhat simple, but complicated enough that I could learn how to use the row and col system. I have 2 LEDS for an underglow.
I plan to paint the keycaps to look like different types of mackerel. Fishes + macropads = mackerelpad! 
The hardest part for me was trying to understand the firmware, but after enough tutorials I was able to create my own macros for keyboard shortcuts. 


# BOM:
- 9x MX switches 
- 1x Seeed XIAO RP4020
- 1x PCB (blue if possible)
- 9x Through-hole 1N4148 Diodes
- 2x SK6812 MINI LEDs
- 9x DSA keycaps (prefer white if possible)
- 4x M3x5Mx4m Heatset inserts
- 4x M3X16mm screws
- 1x 3D printed case (prefer base.stl in black & top.stl in white if possible)
