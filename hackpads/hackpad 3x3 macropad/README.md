# Hackpad 3x3
custom macropad 3x3 with a rotary encoder
it was really fun going through the entire process of designing the pcb to the case and to the firmware!!!
the hardest challenge for me was lowkey getting started because I've been so busy with schools and other extracurriculars that I could not start/bring myself to start because im tired all the time 💀
I'll prb make more boards in the future if I find more uses I need or just for fun! I'm excited to see my board!!!
