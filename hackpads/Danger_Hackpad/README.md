# Hackpad
Please i worked so hard on this.
## Inspiration
I discovered this challenge back in October, but I was so busy that I didn't know how to get started. When version 2 came along, I knew I didn't want to let this one pass me by! I thought it would be great to create a hack pad that makes it super easy to access my favorite apps and Chrome profiles.
## Challenges
I had quite the adventure redesigning the PCB—at least six times! Sometimes it ended up being too big, and other times I just wasn’t thrilled with the results. I also tried importing components into Fusion for the first time, which was a bit of a challenge. In the end, I really enjoyed the experience and was happy to learn so much along the way!
