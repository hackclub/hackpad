# Scottpad V1
Scottpad V1 is a 3x3 macropad with an OLED display and Multi-Use Volume Knob
-----
I created this macropad because I really liked the design of the [Printed Pad](https://protadesigns.com/products/printed-pad?variant=41279531253817) and the functionality, but I perfer a knob better and to have the screen on the other side. I also wanted it to be more customizable and I plan on updating the firmware to display the weather, news, etc. I plan on also adding the feature where I can update the keymaps when I click on the rotary encoder.
- I faced a lot of challenges, including settling on a design I liked (case)
