# ZaidKey v1
	
### Inspiration

I wanted to create a macropad which I can use to fulfill my daily tasks or to use it as macros to
to fill in things I do on a daily basis (such as Opening applications, coding, etc). I have tried to
keep it simple and used less parts (as I was a beginner), I used 6 switches, 1 rp2040, and 2 leds.

### Challenges 

This is my first time trying and doing something like this (pcb and case designing), I faced a lot of challenges, some include not knowing where to connect the wires in the schematic and to use fusion for the first time!
