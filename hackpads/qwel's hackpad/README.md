# Ani's hackpad 
This micropad project was inspired by the iconic design from Friends. While I initially struggled with the 3D design aspect 
 I found the process of crafting and reworking the PCB paths to be incredibly enjoyable and innovative. Each iteration taught me something new, and Iâ€™m proud of how it turned out!
# BOM:
- [ ] 1x PCB
- [ ] 12x Cherry MX switches
- [ ] 2x EC11 Encoder
- [ ] 12x WS2812B LEDs
- [ ] 1x  Seeed Studio XIAO SAMD21
- [ ] 1x  PCF8574

### Would need 2x of knob.stl to be printed 
### pcb and case in black if possible
