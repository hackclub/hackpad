I was looking through my emails one day and saw this opportunity from hack club and I decided to just go for it. The project encompassed all sorts of things that interested me, some I had done before but some things I had never done or done very little of. I decided this would be a fun and cool opporitunity for me to do those things. The hardest challenge I faced was somehow finding time to finish this and my homework. The solution was procrastination lol. The actual hardest part was designing the case. Even though I have used cad before, it is one of my weaknesses and took me longer to finish than the pcb design, which I've never done before. Hopefully this submission gets accepted. And if the firmware somehow works first try that would be amazing.
