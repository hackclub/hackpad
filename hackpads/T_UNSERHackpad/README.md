# T_UNSERHackpad

This is my submission for Hackcklub Hackpad. It should provide music data later in the process of writing the firmware, and then also skipping, pausing and starting songs. The rotary encoder will be responsible for changing volume.

## Design

## Inspiration
Because I like to listen to music a lot and don't always want to look up spotify or some similar apps, I want to have my data on the oled screen directly.
This makes it way easier to shuffle through different songs and will definitely very practical for me.

## Challenges
My biggest challenge in this project was definitely designing the pcb, beacuse I have never done something like this before. Luckily I have already wired up microcontrollers on breadboards, so I had some similar experience before.
Nevertheless, it was very interesting to learn that too, because I lilke learning various new things very much!
