###### (I was unable to find models for ec11 or rp2040, but I did check the dimensions)

A pretty simple hackpad with six keys, an EC11 knob and three leds. It's made to serve as a shortcut hub for my apps and tabs so I can be more productive on both school and personal projects. This is my first time ever making a pcb but I do have experience with electronics so it wasn't that hard. However, the cad was completely new to me so I learned a lot of things there.

The hackpad uses a 3x2 key configuration with the EC11 at the end. On the other side are the leds and the flip side has the rp2040 with an usb port entrance cut out on the pcb.
