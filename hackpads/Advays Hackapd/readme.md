<h1>Advays Hackpad:</h1>

3 key, 1 rotary encoder switch, so it can also be pressed  
KMK  
2 part case, all 3D printed  
Made in F360, Kicad, VSC  


1Ô∏è‚É£ This also the first PCB i've ever made so that was for sure a challenge, but I enjoyed it and might do onboard now.
As for my inspirations, I was looking online and saw a bunch of macropads for $60, but they didnt even have rotary encoders, which is why I incorporated one in my design.
