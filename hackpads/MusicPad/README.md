# MusicPad
This was my first time doing everything here so i learnt a ton, will def use the pcb making skill again for  
my other electronics projects

  
  
### things on the pad:
* 7 switches  
* two rotary encoders that also have switches  
* a gpio expander
* also a screen lol  
## What stuff does  
the bottom three switches are for music control - rewind (a whole song), play/pause, and skip.  
the rotary encoders are for volume, left is master right is only music.  
pressing the rotary encoders mutes their volume (all of it / just music).  
the rest i havent decided yet, prob for other macros for specific things.
