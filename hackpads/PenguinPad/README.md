The penguinpad was a very fun project to work on in our coding club, and i learned the basics of a lotof useful skills. it'll be used for... honestly not entirly sure. probably video game emotes and media control tbh. it was really fun though and i (can't spell) apprcieate that you guys made this possible. *clapping sounds. hopefully there is no errors, but i'll try to fix any errors asap.
