my hackpad is a youtube navigator that can make certain tasks take less time and make watching videos easier. The hardest part was doing the 3d modeling because i am not good with onshape and 3d modeling so there were many errors and had to fix them but thankfully the team helped me and i was able to finish it.

0.5x speed
1x speed
1.5x speed
2x speed

rotary encoder to precisely scroll through the video instead of using the arrow keys which goes forward 5 seconds
oled display to display the video speed and timestamp
