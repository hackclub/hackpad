# Legitmate-Salvage
This is the Legitimate Salvage. It is a macro pad that includes ten keys, one rotary encoder, and one OLED screen. The firmware I set up allows three different tabs, and the OLED screen shows the current tab. This is my first time participating in a Hack Club event. I have only recently been learning Fusion and have never used KiCad or QMK, which was an exciting new opportunity. The hardest part was working with QMK, as I have no experience with firmware, and it was hard to find help or tutorials for the process.



# Cad Model
  There is 2 peices the base and the top which fit together with m3 bolts I made it with fusion

# PCB
I made it in kicad I used most of the recomended footprints but some I had to find on my own I hope its right

# Firmware Overview 
Uses QMK Firmware
- Rotary encoder changes volume for evreything 
- Top Left button changes tabs
- OLED shows current tab
- the other buttons it depends on the current tab being used

# BOM (Bill of Materials):
- 1x Seeed XIAO RP2040
- 9x Through-hole 1N4148 Diodes
- 10x MX-Style switches
- 1x EC11 Rotary encoder
- 10x Black Blank DSA keycaps

# Extra Stuff
This is my first hackclub project. Next I think I am going to work on the infill project becuase why not.
