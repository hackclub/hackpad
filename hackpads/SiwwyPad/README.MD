# SIWWYPAD!
This is my [HackClub](https://hackclub.com/) [HackPad](https://hackpad.hackclub.com/) Project!
It has 9 Keys, 4 LED's, a Rotary Encoder and uses KMK firmware.

## Inspiration
I was Inspired by those macropads OSU players use but i wanted some more buttons so i added some and added a rotary for easy volume control.
Another inspiration was the [MacroBoard](https://github.com/palmacas/MacroBoard).

## Challenges
One of the main Challenges was learning Fusion360 and all of its many many quirks.
Everything else was medium difficulty and could be done pretty quickly.

## hacpad!
This is it this is the hackpad in all its glory (minus the keycaps).
