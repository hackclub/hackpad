- This is a macropad totally built from scratch and has anti ghosting 6 switches.
---
## Inspiration
My insipiration were the popular small macropads on tiktok that are used to play osu. Using this opportunity I wanted to go all out with specs and design and that is what I did. Also, I made it arcane themed ;)

## Challenges
I have no clue how I have managed to build the case for it. It was extremely challenging because I dont have the physical board to measure. I managed to build a really simple design which protects the base of PCB and also avoid the damage incase of a drop lol.
