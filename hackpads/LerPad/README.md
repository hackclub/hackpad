# LerPad

This is my submission for Hack Club's Hackpad YSWS! It is very clunky, so I am sorry if it doesn't turn out great. This is my first time designing a PCB, or using CAD, or QMK. I plan to make a version 2 in the future, and maybe even more versions!

This MacroPad is currently configured as a launch controller for Kerbal Space Program! If it works, you will be able to control movement, stages, SAS, and thrust using this macropad! The idea came from my friend, and I saw this as a perfect opportunity to make a prototype.

The hardest challenge was designing the case, and you can probably tell due to its clunkyness. The case also uses no screws, it is held together purely by gravity (and maybe duct tape), in true Kerbal Space Program fashion. V2 will include screws though. I hope you like it! :D

# BOM

- 4 3D Printed Case Sections (I'm sorry it's a lot!)
- 1 PCB
- 1 XIAO-RP2040
- 1 SSD1306 128*32 0.91 inch OLED screen
- 1 EC11 Rotary Encoder (Pressable, works as a switch)
- 9 1N4148 Diodes
- 8 Gateron Milky Yellow Switches (Cherry MX works too, I don't mind!)
- 8 Keycaps

I can solder it myself if you want! :D

I would prefer a black PCB if possible!

I would like the case to be 3D printed as a dark gray or black color please! If possible, it would be great if the Outline and Case could be black, while the Plate and OLED_Plate could be gray, but I don't mind! :D
