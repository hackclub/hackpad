* 4x M3 16mm screws
* 1x PCB
* 3x 3d-printed case parts
* 1x Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040
* 4x Cherry MX switches 
* 4x DSA keycaps 
* 1x EC11 rotary encoder

* In this project, I learned a lot and also had lots of fun. It was an new experience for me, learning how to design and make my PCB using KiCAD, with invaluable help from the seniors. I faced a few problems, like having extrude errors on OnShape, but everything else went relatively smoothly. By far the most difficult part was doing the PCB, as I was not familiar at all with the software and PCB's in the first place, whereas OnShape I had some background knowledge. My hackpad is going to be a spotify music helper.
