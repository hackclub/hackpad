## Slight quirks of the Funkypad:
- A WS2812B under every key
- Only 15 keys yet still technically a 4x4 layout
- Every component is on the top layer
- ~The case has no top, so you can see the beautiful PCB~ Thin top, so the entire thing looks complete

## Bill of materials:
- 15x of:
    - Cherry MX switches
    - DSA keycaps
    - Through-hole 1N4148 diodes
    - WS2812Bs
- 1x PCB
- 1x Seeed XIAO RP2040
- 1x 3D printed case

Note: I have screws already, and the case is designed around the specific screws I own
