# Kalpad
The Kalpad is a 12-key macropad with two rotary encoders intended to be used with Procreate!

## Inspiration
I wanted to create something that felt truly "me", whilst also going out of my comfort zone. I wanted to combine aesthetics with functionality, resulting in the Kalpad!

## PCB
The silkscreen was illustrated in Procreate as a fun Easter egg for when the macro pad is being worked on and/or taken apart.

## Firmware Overview
This hackpad uses KMK firmware for everything.
This will likely change in the futureâ€” the Kalpad was designed to be flexible, so I'd like to add different functionalities outside of Procreate.
