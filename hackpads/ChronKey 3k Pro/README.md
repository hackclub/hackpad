# ChronKey 3k Pro
A small, 3-key macropad made by Swarit Choudhari

I've never made a PCB before, nor have I written code for QMK...
I got to build apon my Fusion360 skills though...

I've always wanted to create a macropad, but it was too hard (or so I thought...)
So here it is... the ChronKey 3k Pro! Should match with my Keychron k6 Pro I got from the hackClub arcade!
