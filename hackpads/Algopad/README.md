Inspiration:
There are certain keybinds that are useful when using a program I commonly use, so I figured that ti would be fun to have a dedicated key for each of them (that isn't just a key on my keyboard!)

Challenges:
While I have worked with hardware in the past, this was a very software-involved project. It was my first time using GitHub as well, so it was very difficult uploading this project. However, it has inspired me to start learning more software skills!
