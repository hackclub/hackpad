# al1k's Hackpad!!!
## Background Information
Being a student in UWC ISAK Japan, and taking IB Computer Science, I still feel dumb when it comes to Computer Science. That's when I stumbled upon Hackclub, although I don't have a lot of free time (duhh its IB) I still want to continue self-developing like in the times before IB. I used a guide to make this Hackpad, soon enough I will create my own project hopefully.

## Challenges
I am using school's laptop, and the performance is AWFUL!! Trying to navigate both KiCad and Fusion360 on this piece of machinery was quite a hustle. ESPECIALLY navigating using the touch pad. Thankfully it's done now.
