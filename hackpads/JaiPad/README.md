# JaiPad

A compact custom macro keyboard built with a Seeed XIAO controller, featuring 12 KAILH Low Profile switches and 8 SK6812 RGB LEDs for a sleek, minimalist design with visual feedback.

## Inspiration

The JaiPad was born from the desire to create a streamlined, efficient workflow tool that combines the tactile satisfaction of mechanical switches with the visual feedback of RGB lighting. The compact form factor of the XIAO controller and low-profile switches makes it perfect for a desk setup without taking up too much space.

## Bill of Materials (BOM)

- 1x Seeed XIAO Controller
- 12x KAILH Choc White (clicky)
-1x rotary encoder
- PCB and mounting hardware
  4x heatset m3
  4x m3 bolts
- Case 

## Technical Challenges

Some of the main challenges encountered during this project include:
- Managing power distribution for the SK6812 LEDs while ensuring stable operation
- Optimizing the PCB layout to maintain the compact form factor while accommodating all components
- Balancing the LED brightness with power consumption
- Ensuring reliable switch mounting with the low-profile design
