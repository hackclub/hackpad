### Inspiration

I was inspired by the 23lives ["Foot Keyboard"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwqtAuxATQg) that was making rounds in Hypixel Skyblock a while ago. I looked at it and thought "hmm, i wonder if you could play osu with that". I started with 4 keys, one for each note in 4K Mania, and a rotary encoder, for spinners. As I was making it, I realized it would be a lot cooler and more useful as a macropad, so I wrote the firmware for some of my most useful hotkeys.

### Challenges

While I have minimal experience in EasyEDA for NFC Hacker Cards and Onshape for school (our school made all 7th graders learn basic 3d modeling), this was my first time making a real project in KiCad and Fusion. While there was a fair bit of trial and error, my experience helped it go smoothly.
