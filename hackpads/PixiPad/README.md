# PixiPad

![PixiPad CAD](pictures/catpad%20cad.png)

I remember during one of the hackpad workshops, Alex was talking about making macropad keychains. The idea of macropads you can wear just kinda interested me, so I made a hackpad necklace. ðŸ˜­

The shape of the PixiPad is based off of my current pfp, which is my persona.

The holes on the left and right side of the macropad are for putting string into. The heart is 3D printed separately, and I'm planning on painting it later.

In the files its called the catpad, but there already exists a hackpad called that so now its just the PixiPad, which sounds cooler anyways.

### Challenges

Probably the most challenging part of designing this was making the PCB. I don't know anything about hardware, like I barely knew what a PCB was before making my hackpad. Figuring out where everything was supposed to go, what everything meant, learning a new software (KiCad), it was all such a pain. Thankfully, the CAD part wasn't too hard since I already had experience with Onshape.
