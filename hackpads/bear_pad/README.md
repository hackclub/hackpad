# Bear's Hack Pad

I wanted to create my macropad to help me with video editing and CAD. I enjoyed learning how to design PCBs however the QMK was a little bit difficult to get figured out, I finally got a version to compile once I fixed the key matrix but all it does is bind the keys to hotkeys, once I get my macropad I plan to experiment with the QMK further and implement different layers of macros as well as display which layer it is currently on on the display.
