## Project - Kuba's fake calculator

When  I heard about this chalange I knew I had to try to build my own macropad. I had never create a electronic thing like this, so it was absolutely new experience to me. I learned a lot about designing a pcb and I hope this knowlege will be uesfull in the future. Overall it was a really good time but I struggled a litlle with fusion 360 program but i managed to use it.

## Design

my hackpad uses 9 switches and 4 rgb diodes and 1 rotary encoder switch

## Speciications
### BOM

12x Cherry MX switches
1x EC11 Rotary Encoder
4x SK6812 MINI LED 
4x M3x16mm screws
1x XIAO-RP2040-DIP
1x case (2 printed parts)
1x custom pcb 
12x DSA keycaps (black if possible)
12x 1N4148 diodes

Firmware
case top part
case bottom part

(im sorry for having do diodes in case but my fusion skils arent that good)

## Firmware
by macropad is desugned for having 3 layers and with this I have 36 keybinds instead of 12. User know which layer is he on because of diodes that tell him which layer is he using


### Others
It was nicely spent time and if I would able to I would take part in that project again
