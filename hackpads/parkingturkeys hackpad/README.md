# PARKING TURKEYS'S awesome hackpad :3c

*abbreviated as p-t's hackpad :3c*
p-t's hackpad :3c is a 4 key macropad arranged in the style of arrow keys. You can use it for playing games and typing and stuf.


## Features:
- Keys.
- the power of WONDERHOY⭐
- 4 LEDs
- ✨customizability✨

## CAD Model:
Everything fits together using 5 M3 Bolts and heatset inserts. 4 for the case, one for the PCB. Also, it has a 5 degree tilt

It has 2 separate printed pieces. The bottom and the top cover.

It was made by moving around the tutorial a bit

## Firmware Overview
This hackpad uses [KMK](https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware/) firmware for everything. 

- I'm using the keys as arrows for now
- I would like to try macros at some point
- IDK how the LED works :heavysob:

I might add more in the future! That's it for now

## BOM:
Here should be everything you need to make this hackpad

- 4x Cherry MX Switches
- 4x DSA Keycaps (preferred black)
- 4x M3x16 Bolt
- 4x SK6812 MINI Leds
- 1x Case (2 printed parts)
- 1x XIAO RP2040

... this is probably wrong :heavysob:

## Extra stuff
