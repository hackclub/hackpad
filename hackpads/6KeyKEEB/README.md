# 6keyKEEB

Tired of boring scrolling? Use the 6keyKEEB, with buttons for page up, page down, and all the arrow keys! how nice  
Inspiration: I like to read novels on websites or as pdfs, so I came up with the idea to make an all in one scroller.  
Challenges: Figuring out dimensions for the case was the toughest part personally, but I think I got it in the end!
