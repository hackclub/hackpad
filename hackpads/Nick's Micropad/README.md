### Inspiration

I wanted a macropad for using shortcuts/macros for things like in blender switching from renderer view to wireframe view. and i used 16 keys to let be add more stuff later if i want  

### Challenges

This was my second time using Fusion 360! The first time i wanted to experiment on my own but it was a compete failure, so this was great to actualy learn to use the program. I'm very proud of the result. I was very happy about the stuff i have leared from Duccs Fidget Toy tutorial and when i tried to aply the things he did to my idea is worked flawlessy, Thanks again.
