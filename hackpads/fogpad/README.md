# Fogpad
A mechanical WASD type macropad with multitude of customisation options (working on them) that can allow you to use it as a music controller, WASD for video games, volume, brightness controls or just a regular macropad with tons of shortcuts!

## How it looks
Sorry, I couldn't find 3d models of the switches and knobs and stuff
