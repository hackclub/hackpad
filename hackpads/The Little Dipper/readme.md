# Little Dipper
![Full model](https://cdn.hackclubber.dev/slackcdn/e49244a3df7196b9a0f0a6e66876d948.png)
Little Dipper is a custom 3-key macropad designed for the Hackpad competition. It runs **KMK firmware.**\
I made it to make it easier for me to copy and paste and save :)

## Features

- **3 Keys** for copy, paste, save
- **KMK Firmware** with CircuitPython support
- **XIAO RP2040** as the microcontroller
- **RGB LEDs** for star constellation effect
- **Compact & ergonomic design**
- **Custom PCB** designed in KiCad
- \*\*Case Designed in Fusion360 \*\*



## CAD Model

Everything fits together using **M3 bolts and heatset inserts**, ensuring a sturdy assembly. The design is optimized for easy assembly and accessibility.



The case consists of:

- A **base** for PCB mounting
- A **top cover** to hold switches
- Cutouts for USB access and RGB diffusion

## PCB Design

The **Little Dipper's PCB** was designed in **KiCad**, featuring MX-style key switches and SK6812 MINI LEDs.

## Firmware Overview

This macropad uses **KMK firmware**, allowing dynamic key remapping and advanced macros.

- Each key can be programmed for **copy, paste and save**
- **White RGB glow**

## Bill of Materials (BOM)

To build your own **Little Dipper**, you'll need:

- **3x** Cherry MX-compatible switches
- **3x**Â Blank DSA white keycaps
- **5x** M3x5x4 Heatset Inserts
- **5x** M3 Screws (varied sizes for case assembly)
- **2x** SK6812 MINI LEDs
- **1x** XIAO RP2040 microcontroller
- **1x** Custom PCB (KiCad design)
- **1x** Case (3D Printed)
- 1x Piece of acrylic (25mmx55.5mm) (Optional)

## Fun Fact

The Little dipper's LED constellation is the Little Dipper itself :)
