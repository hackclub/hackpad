# MIDIpad

An independent venture into MIDI controllers.

## ‚ú® What 

In its current state, MIDIpad is as the name implies: a portable 12-key MIDI controller
with an admittedly non-standard key layout (order: left to right, top to bottom). There
are three knobs for interfacing with a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), and when pressed,
for switching between three MIDI channels.

The future vision is to make a portable and minimal looper, able to load samples or
plugins from an SD card, while still functioning as a MIDI device.

## ‚ùì Why

Although I own a MIDI piano, I find the linear layout to be less intuitive for drumming.
I took great inspiration by Launchpads‚ÄîI don't own one, but I value the grid-based
interface. However, although flashy, I don't need the full 64 keys that Launchpads offer,
so that became my initial motivation for this device.
