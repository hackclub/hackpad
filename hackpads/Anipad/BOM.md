# Anipad

# BOM:
- 11x Cherry MX switches
- 1x EC11 Encoder
- 1x PCB - black with white drawings if possible
- 12x Through-hole 1N4148 Diodes
- 1x 0.91" OLED
- 3x M3 heated inserts, the same ones as in OrpheusPad
- 2x M3x12 screws
- 1x M3x20 screw
- 3D printed parts: the design on the underside of the Bottom is printable without supports, as is the USB port. All models are to be printed in the orientation they are in the .step file, in black PLA.

# Important note:
Assuming that three PCBs, each with its components, are included in the mail, I'd like one pre-soldered and two unsoldered.
If only one of the PCBs comes with components, I'd like it pre-soldered. Also, I wouldn't want the OLED soldered on any of the PCBs.
Thanks.
