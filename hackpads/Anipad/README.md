# The Anipad

## Overview

Hey! This is Anicetus, and here is my Hackpad, a macropad project from https://hackclub.com. It uses a Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040 with a custom-made case, PCB, and QMK firmware.
It has 11 buttons (not including the rotary encoder) aligned in a 4x3 matrix. The Anipad's primary use is to control my 3D printer without access to a phone or computer. It'll plug into my Raspberry Pi which controls the printer and send commands to print files, move the axes, etc.
The Anipad is equipped with a 0.91" OLED screen and a rotary encoder.

## About the Anipad

I can shamelessly say that I copied @grimsteel a lot on Slack. He was a big help to getting this thing rolling. However, most of the PCB and all of the case is my own design. On the back of the case is a Penrose Triangle, commonly known as the Impossible Triangle. I have a semi-obssession with it, and it only seemed right to include it.
The name "Anipad" comes from my name, Anicetus, which means "Unconquerable" in Latin, a language I'm proud to say I can speak ~~decently well~~ OK I guess. Autem, sum non bonus in conspectu populi.
<br/>***ANYWAYS***, I love coding, making, and hacking, and despite arriving with less than 10 days left in the Hackpad project, I feel I did decently well. And, of course, I needed to add its name in the front.
