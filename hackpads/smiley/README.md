# Smiley
I am Loshua1, the creator of Smiley, a pad made for shortcuts. I originally wanted to make it because I just wanted a way for me to access things faster, but I learned how to use KiCad and QMK laong the way (kinda) ! (I already knew how to use Onshape.)

# BOM:
(I would like the case to be 3d printed in black and I would like red keycaps)

Here is the Bill Of Materials:

- 1x PCB
- 1x XIAO RP2040
- 8x Cherry MX Switches
- 8x Cherry MX 1.00u Keycaps
