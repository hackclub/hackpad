<h1>WILLIAMS HACKPAD</h1>
<p1>HELLO!!!! I made an awesome 6 key micropad with 2 rotary encoders and 2 LEDS and uses QMK fw.

This is a project for hackclub (which is really awesome if you want to check it out)</p1>
<h2>CAD Model:</h2>
<p1> I really don't have much to say, my fushion is ok, because I have a 3D printer, but ya'know, fushion sucks </p1>

  -6 keys that I am going to use for macros
  
  -gooly goodness I don't like qmk, but we perserve!!!!! :)))
