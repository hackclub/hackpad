# About:
Ever since i learnt you can quickly open apps on the taskbar by using the WIN key with the respective number, it's become a staple of my life. The keypad just helps do that a little easier! Additionally, I am a huge music fan so i need some dedicated media control keys. The remaining keys are placeholders for stuff I will setup in the future (Copy paste and save? Dedicated valorant keybinds? idk)
