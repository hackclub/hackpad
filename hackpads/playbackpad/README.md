# Playbackpad

A pad with a rotary encoder and 3 switches to control playback and volume. I made this because it's painful to go to the app and click on pause every time it's my time to talk in a meeting <i>yes I listen to music while meeting 😁</i>.

## PCB

I quite enjoyed the PCB making process even though it was painful to find libraries for the OLED so I didn't use it.

Made the casing with Fusion 360, quite painful to make the holes ngl 💀🙏
