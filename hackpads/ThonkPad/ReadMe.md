**ThonkPad**
A simple, open concept micropad with 6 keys, 1 rotary encoder, and a 0.91 inch oled display.

Why did I make it?
I stumbling accross this YSWS when searching the Hack Club Slack. I have always wanted a micropad and thought it would be fun to learn how to design a pcb and make a micropad!

What is/are the hardest challenge(s) you faced?
The hardest challenge was definatly the firmware. The firmware was very confusing and the tutorial for the rotary encoder did not work. (I'll probably end up debugging the code once everything arrives.)
