# Trainpad
This is my first attempt at a macropad, I decided to approach it from a train theme for something fun. It comes with a case that resembles a train, 10 keys and 1 encoder.

Figuring out firmware and PCB design took my a while, as particularly with the PCB, it was my first foray into its design.

Thanks for Hack Club for running.
