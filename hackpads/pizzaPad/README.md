# pizzaPad
Hey, I'm pizzalover125. I made the pizzaPad, a basic macropad that can be used for anything! I used Easy
EDA for the PCB, Onshape for the CAD, and Arduino for the firmware. Features include 9 switches and one OLED screen! The project took roughly 20 hours, mostly 
spent troubleshooting CAD software (Fusion mostly). I'm usually designing software, so learning this
intricate hardware was amazing. 

## PCB + Schematic

This part was SUPER easy with Alex's tutorials and stuff. It didn't take too much time when I got the hang of it. The only hard part was trying to use KiCad and failing, then switching to EASYEDA.

## Case

THIS PART WAS SOOOO HARD. First, I used Autodesk. I signed up for Autodesk Student, and for some reason, it got declined. I appealed the decision, and the person agreed that I was a student, but thought a government ID card, a passport, a student ID, a transcript, and a progress report weren't good proof. Okay, then I used the free edition. IT SUCKED. Nothing was working and it was all too buggy. But then, I switched to the wonderful Onshape and finished it in 1 hour. 

## Firmware

Pretty simple as I knew Arduino beforehand. 

## BOM

BOM is in BOM.md
