# Hash-AK's Hackpad (HashPad)

This is my macropad, made for the (awesome!) Hackpad V2 program of Hackclub (https://hackpad.hackclub.com)


I will use this hackpad for (eventually) Hyprland control (like workspace switching) or as a mini protable keyboard (TBD)

What I found particuliary difficult was the case design, I couldn't use Fusion and FreeCAD was hard to use, even with the tutorial (Cyao in the slack helped me alot for that).
