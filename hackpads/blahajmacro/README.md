## Info:
This board is mainly made for the purpose of having a couple of keybinds on each layer (controlled by rotary encoder(s)), and to have ease of customizability.

## Design:
The design is planned to have with a black pcb, and either laser cut acrylic pieces and/or 3d printed pieces for the case connected by M3 screws and nuts.
