## Notes
This was hell ngl. I am absolutely *awful* at electronics design, and combine that with the joys of Linux software compatability regarding Fusion 360, I have lost so much sleep over this. I honestly think the firmware was the easiest part of this, and that's saying something.

10/10 experience would do again.
