# Epad
This is my submission for Hackpad V2!

## Inspiration
I was inspired by a macropad that I saw in a YouTube video a while back. It looked really cool so I tried to replicate it as best as I could from memory.

## Challenges
My biggest challenge was getting everything to line up correctly. I know I spent a long time just getting every hole at the top lined up with the switches.

## Features
- 12x cherry mx keys
- 1x rotary encoder switch
- KMK firmware
