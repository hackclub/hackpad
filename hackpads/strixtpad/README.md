Hello Everyone! This is my custom macorpad! Fully designed with 12 switches all with the function of using as f keys (my keyboard doesn't have dedicated f keys LOL).

I was origrinally going with an 11 key design that also had a knob and an LCD screen, however, I realized my time constraints and had to just settle with 12 key macropad (poor time management skills came in clutch at the wrong moment!)
