# MohaPad

Creating the MohaPad was a long and challenging process, especially when it came to 3D designing the case. I spent a lot of time trying to get the dimensions just right, but every design I made didn’t fit as I expected. Eventually, I decided to hold off on uploading any 3D designs for the case because I couldn’t get the sizes right. I’ve temporarily given up on that part and will only design and print the case once I receive the pad and can measure everything accurately.


The MohaPad itself has 9 buttons, an EC11 rotary encoder, and a 0.96-inch screen. It’s programmable with any firmware you prefer. I used QMK to program mine initially, but I felt it didn’t fully meet my needs. That’s why I’m planning to reprogram it using Arduino IDE once the pad arrives.

# BOM:
- 1x Through-hole Seeed XIAO RP2040
- 9x Kailh Choc V2s
- 9x Kailh Hotswap sockets
- 1x EC11 Encoder
- 10x Through-hole 1N4148 Diodes
- 17x SK6812-E LEDs
- 1x 0.96 inch OLED displays
- 9x SMD Capacitors (104 = 0.1u)
