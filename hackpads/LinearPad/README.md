### Inspiration

I wanted to create a macropad that allowed to use macros and work more efficiently. I tried to make something similar in the past but it was difficult and I was unable to get much farther than the base schematic, with this it allowed me to improve and learn more with better resources and this time I was able to do it! I created a macropad using 4 switches, 1 oled, 1 encoder, and 6 leds. 

### Challenges

This was my first time using Kicad! It ended up taking a lot of time and asking for help on slack but I'm pretty proud of the final product. I had the most struggle figuring out how to make footprints work. Through a lot of trial error and pestering others with my endless questions I was able to create this macropad.
