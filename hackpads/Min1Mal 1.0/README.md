## Inspiration

I wanted to build a minimalist numpad that gave me back the keys I lost when going to a 75 percent keyboard.

## Challenges

I am terrible at anything software related, so first figuring out how to use KiCAD, which wasn't all that bad, but then figuring out the actual firmware for this as well.

## Specifications

BOM: 

 - 9x Cherry MX Switches
 - 1x SK6812 MINI-E LED
 - 1x XIAO RP2040
 - 9x Blank Keycaps (White?)
 - 6x M3 Heatset Insert
 - 4x M3x12 Bolts (I have these myself, do not need any)

Others:

 - KMK Firmware
 - Case Top V2.step
 - Case Bottom.step
