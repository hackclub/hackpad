# Purpose
**12-key macropad intended for ultrakill gaming**
has all movement keys, macro for knuckleblaster punch without swapping, rotary encoder for weapon swapping and an extra key for a Railcannon
has RGB diodes intended for showing things like style/hard damage (if i can implement that)
I made it mainly because school keyboards suck and i wanted to P-rank in spite of that
