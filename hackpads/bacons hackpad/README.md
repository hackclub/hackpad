#Baconpad
This is a somewhat basic hackpad that I have been designing, three iterations with countless revisions, it has 4 keys and rotatary encoders.

## Features
 - 128x32 OLED Display
 - 2x EC11 Rotary Encoders
 - 4 Keys

## CAD Model
Honestly not sure if this will work, I will definitely refine it further once I see what it physically looks like. It currently is two parts,
a base and a top layer.
I also plan to redisign it to not need screws to attach the top and bottom. 
It should use the M3 screws and heatset inserts.

## PCB
I use KiCAD to design the entire PCB.

## BOM
Here is everything that should be needed.

 - 1x 0.91" 128x32 OLED Display
 - 2x EC11 Rotary Encoder
 - 1x XIAO RP2040
 - 4x M3x16mm SHCS Bolts
 - 2X M3x12mm SHCS Bolts
 - 6x M3x5x4 Heatset inserts
 - 4x DSA Keycaps
 - 4x Cherry MX Switches
 - 6x 1N4148 Through-hole diodes

## Extra
I learned a lot from this event, even if I am too late for sumbitting thank you for putting this together. I also plan to print the case on my own. As for the rotary switches I plan to do volume control with one, and switching keymaps with another
