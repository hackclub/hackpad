NOTE: there's something wrong with my gh desktop, it cant clone and the pcb is too big to upload. my firmware and case are here, you can find my pcb info at github.com/ayaangrover/macropad and the contents of the original PR that got mixed up at https://github.com/hackclub/hackpad/tree/92f5367d3a3a12743b4da5b1d89bd3bd2a3c4d15/hackpads/ninefold. 


**Summary:** This project started out with a YouTube tutorial. I learnt quite a lot and later(i challenged myself to do the whole macropad without looking at the video) I managed to make my own macropad(with the help of many people on the hack club slack). While it was challenging to make my first PCB, the community helped me fix errors and I eventually overcame the issues I had been facing. The whole experiene left me more confident in my skills and I feel ready to take on the challenge of building a full keyboard now!
