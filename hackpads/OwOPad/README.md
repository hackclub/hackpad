# OwOMacro

OwOMacro is a 4 key macropad with a rotary encoder.


## Challange 

well I wanted to go with something simple yet useful 
I plan to use the rotary as a little vol dial and the buttons mapped to F13-F16 as little hot keys 
As this is my first PCB I had a bit of trouble understanding out to route the traces at first but got a hang of that pretty quick 



## Features:
- Rotary encoder
- 4 Keys

## CAD Model:
A simple single part case , reavealing the PCB pretty much beacause PCBs are cool :3

## BOM:
Here should be everything you need to make this hackpad

- 4x Cherry MX Switches
- 4x Keycaps of your choice
- 1x EC11 Rotary Encoder (schematic is done with PEC12R) 
- 1x XIAO RP2040
- 1x Case 


### footnote
tbh stole this README from the [Orpheuspad](https://github.com/hackclub/hackpad/blob/main/hackpads/orpheuspad/README.md) so yea check that out :3
