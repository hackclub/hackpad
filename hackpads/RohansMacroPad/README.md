## What it is
I wanted to follow the tutorial on [hackpad.hackclub.com](hackpad.hackclub.com) accurately and make a macropad.

## What it does
Gives me one point on Highway per extra key I will now have to press and make my computer do things.

## How I made it
I followed the tutorial on Hackclub's website! It was very good at teaching me the basics of everything!
I kinda gave up for a few weeks before picking it back up again. I am working on my Summer of Making project at the same time!

I made a big mistake, and tried to submit the same thing as in the tutorial. I missed the part where it specifies that it must be something different, LOL.
I fixed it all up pretty quick after that, though, spending two days making my own unique design and submitting it.
