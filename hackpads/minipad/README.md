# Minipad
My first time experimenting with PCB, keyboards, firmware and everything that comes along with it.
To keep things simple, I created a simple 4 switch grid (with one rotary encoder) direct wired to the microcontroller.
The case is another simple design, with a rectangular shape with curved corners, with some empty space to add some stickers or similar.
