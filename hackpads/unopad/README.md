# Micropad
This is a numpad-sized macropad I designed during Hackclub's Hackpad event. I probably spent about 10 hours on this project since I hadn't done pcb design or CAD before. I had the most trouble with the CAD and I'm hoping to make revisions to the case after the event is finished. I've made a basic QMK firmware for the Micropad with simple layers, allowing for use as a numpad and macropad but with some not so great key mappings that still need revisions.
