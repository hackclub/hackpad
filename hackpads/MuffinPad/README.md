# MuffinPad

My main inspiration to do this project was that I always wanted a keyboard with a nice thocky sound, and im hoping to get that out of the gateron milky yellows :) (hopefully the case doesn't ruin the sound)

The hardest part of this was probably the schematic + PCB stuff with the really complex wiring and stuff with all the design rules to follow. Took me all day lol

Hopefully everything turns out well! Bye!

Also wanted to give a huge shoutout to [@Anicetus](https://github.com/invictus-anic3tus) for helping with almost all aspects of this project. I would have never finished my macropad by the deadline if weren't for him, considering I started on the 17th with absolutely 0 knowledge in PCBs, schematics, CAD, or firmware. 

My Slack is @dinesh
