the hardest thing i've ever made and it doesn't even have a matrix :/
* the firmware might be messy, i was lost on that part
* i was lost on every part actaully
* dont worry about the colors for the case, i was thinking of just painting it!! (i mean unless your 3d printer has those colors)

# BOM:
* 3x Cherry MX Switches
* 1x PCB
* 3x Blank DSA keycaps
