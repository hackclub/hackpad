# My Awesome Custom Keyboard!

This is my project for a custom keyboard. It's got 13 keys (like a mini-keyboard), an OLED screen, and some cool Neopixel lights.

## What it does

It's basically a small keyboard that I can use for gaming or anything else.  The OLED screen can show stuff, and the Neopixels light up!
