# Inspiration
I wanted to create this macropad for doing pixel art. I created a macropad using 1 rp2040, 9 switches, and rotary encoder.

# Challenges
It was really hard for me to do all the routing in the pcb in kicad and the extrude part was also really hard. I had to watch a ton of video guides and even had to ask gemini for help but in the end I somehow made it and I think the end design is really good.
