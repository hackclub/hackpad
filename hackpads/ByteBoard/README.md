The First Iteration of DynamicWhiteHat's Macropad

A 3x3 switch matrix with a 128x32 OLED and rotary encoder

## Inspiration
I wanted to create a useful hackpad to streamline backend development after watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_oSLBZABGA&t=1s">this video</a>

## Challenges
I had to remake my case multiple times as I am new to Fusion and had a hard time figuring out measurements. However, after watching Ducc's tutorial from a Zoom Workshop, I was able to get it finished in time!

## BOM:
- 9x Cherry MX Switches
- 8x SK6812 MINI Leds
- 1x XIAO RP2040
- 9x Blank DSA Keycaps
  - 3x Red, 3x Black, 3x White
- 4x M3x16 Bolt
- 4x M3 Heatset
- 9x 1N4148 Diodes
- 1x EC11 Rotary Encoder
- 1x 128x32 OLED

## Features
- 128x32 OLED Display
- Rotary Encoder to control volume or media
