# Example of sound playback from VS1053 FeatherWing.  Can be modified to work
# with the breakout by changing the SD card and SPI pins mentioned below.
# NOTE:
# Unfortunately this doesn't work--the loop isn't fast enough to feed the VS1053
# data at the rate it needs for playback.  You'll see very erratic behavior with
# the VS1053 making static, stopping, and eventually requiring a hard reset.
# We'll need to look into interrupt support perhaps to monitor DREQ like in the
# arduino library.  Basic sine wave playback does however work and monitoring
# of attributes like status register and other VS1053 state is accessible.

SDCS = board.D5  # Pin connected to SD card CS line.
MP3CS = board.D6  # Pin connected to VS1053 CS line.
DREQ = board.D9  # Pin connected to VS1053 DREQ line.
XDCS = board.D10  # Pin connected to VS1053 D/C line.


# Other configuration:
PLAYBACK_FILE = "/sd/test.wav"  # Name of file to play.
# This should be the full path
# including /sd prefix if on
# sd card.

BUFFER_SIZE = 128  # Size in bytes of the MP3 data buffer for sending data to
# the VS1053.


# Setup SPI bus (hardware SPI).

# Setup SD card and mount it in the filesystem.
sd_cs = digitalio.DigitalInOut(SDCS)

storage.mount(vfs, "/sd")

# To list all the files on the SD card root uncomment:
# import os
# print('SD card root contains:')
# print(os.listdir('/sd'))

# Setup VS1053.
vs1053 = adafruit_vs1053.VS1053(spi, MP3CS, XDCS, DREQ)

# Set volume of left and right channels.
# Value ranges from 0 to 255 for each channel, the lower the higher volume.
