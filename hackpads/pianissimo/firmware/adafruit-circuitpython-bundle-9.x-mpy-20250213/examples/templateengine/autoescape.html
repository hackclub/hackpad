        Example of autoescaping unsafe characters in HTML
    </title>
</head>

<body>
    This would be a {{ "<b>bold text</b>" }}, but autoescaping is turned on, so all
    unsafe characters are escaped.

    {% autoescape off %}
        This is a {{ "<b>bold text</b>" }}, because autoescaping is turned off in this block.

        {% autoescape on %}
            And again, this is not a {{ "<b>bold text</b>" }},
            because in this block autoescaping is turned on again.
        {% endautoescape %}
    {% endautoescape %}
</body>
