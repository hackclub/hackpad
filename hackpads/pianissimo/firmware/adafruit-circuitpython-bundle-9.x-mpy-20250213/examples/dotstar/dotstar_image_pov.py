# This example runs on SBC devices like Raspberry Pi.

# Persistence-of-vision (POV) example for Adafruit DotStar RGB LED strip.
# Loads image, displays column-at-a-time on LEDs at very high speed,
# suitable for naked-eye illusions.
# See dotstar_simpletest.py for a much simpler example script.
# See dotstar_image_paint.py for a slightly simpler light painting example.
# This code accesses some elements of the dotstar object directly rather
# than through function calls or setters/getters...this is poor form as it
# could break easily with future library changes, but is the only way right
# now to do the POV as quickly as possible.
# May require installing separate libraries.
