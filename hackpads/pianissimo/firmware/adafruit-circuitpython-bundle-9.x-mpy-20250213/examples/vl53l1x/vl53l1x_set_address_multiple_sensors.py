VL53L1X multiple sensor I2C set_address demo.

This example is written for two sensors, but it can easily be modified to include more.

NOTE: A multitude of sensors may require more current than the on-board 3V regulator can output.
The typical current consumption during active range readings is about 19 mA per sensor.
