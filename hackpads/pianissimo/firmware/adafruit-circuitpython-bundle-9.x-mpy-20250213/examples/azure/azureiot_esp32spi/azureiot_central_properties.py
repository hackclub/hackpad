# To use Azure IoT Central, you will need to create an IoT Central app.
# You can either create a free tier app that will live for 7 days without an Azure subscription,
# Or a standard tier app that will last for ever with an Azure subscription.
# The standard tiers are free for up to 2 devices
#
# If you don't have an Azure subscription:
#
# If you are a student, head to https://aka.ms/FreeStudentAzure and sign up, validating with your
#  student email address. This will give you $100 of Azure credit and free tiers of a load of
#  service, renewable each year you are a student
#
# If you are not a student, head to https://aka.ms/FreeAz and sign up to get $200 of credit for 30
#  days, as well as free tiers of a load of services
#
# Create an Azure IoT Central app by following these instructions:
# https://aka.ms/CreateIoTCentralApp
# Add a device template with telemetry, properties and commands, as well as a view to visualize the
# telemetry and execute commands, and a form to set properties.
#
# Next create a device using the device template, and select Connect to get the device connection
# details.
# Add the connection details to your secrets.py file, using the following values:
#
# 'id_scope' - the devices ID scope
# 'device_id' - the devices device id
# 'device_sas_key' - the devices primary key
#
# The adafruit-circuitpython-azureiot library depends on the following libraries:
