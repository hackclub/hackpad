What was your inspiration to make it?:
My inspiration was the fact that I had been looking at macropads for a while but never actually got around to making one. I also needed something to control the controls in certain apps like discord, fusion 360 and prusaslicer without resorting to complicated shortcuts.
Hardest challenges faced:
FIRMWARE. The firmware was the most complicated part of the build by far as ive designed pcbs and 3d models before. The firmware is still a bit iffy as all the guides I could find required the rp2040 to actually compile the full .uf2 fgile, so hopefully this is something to work on once i've to the physical parts.
Other fun facts to know:
This is something i've wanted to do for a while and now I get do do it! I think hack club is a great thing for high schoolers as it gives the motivation and funds to experiment and have fun with cool projects like this, so thanks guys!
