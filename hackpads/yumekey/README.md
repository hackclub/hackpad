So named because I intend to use it for [Yume Nikki Online](https://ynoproject.net/), particularly the OLED for displaying location updates.

All of this was new to me. I have never designed a schematic, PCB, or case before, nor have I ever programmed firmware for any processor. Expectantly, it did not really quite work out (edit: IT ACTUALLY DIDSIES), but I still managed
to finish it two weeks late (edit: TWO DAYS EARLY).

I'd prefer if the case was printed in black filament if available, with the center key plate being white filament (or some other fancy color I guess).
