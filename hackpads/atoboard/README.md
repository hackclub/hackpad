# Atoboard 

This is a macropad made by me theatom06. It is used for easy controlling of my device

## Case

I decided to make a case from a clear material i have instead of the 3d but i did need a base and top plate so i made them from 3d printed parts

## BOD

- 1x XIAO-RP2040-DIP
- 1x IO expander MCP23017 SO
- 12x SW Cherry MX
- 12x 1N4148 diodes
- 1x reverse mount neopixels
- 4x 5mm screws
- 1x 0.96" OLED display
- 1x EC11 rotary encoder
- 2x 4.7kΩ. resistors (for expander)
- 2x resistors for the oled display; i think 4.7kΩ i could be wrong
- 1x 3d printed base and top plate
- 1x clear material for the case if possible

## Colors 
- PCB: Black
