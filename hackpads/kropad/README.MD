# kropad
A custom 3x2 macropad with a knob/rotary encoder. <br>
<br>
It was quite the challenge to design but I feel like I've learned alot from the process. The lack of instructions was frustrating at times but I pushed through. Hopefully I did everything right, cuz I would be very sad if something didn't fit, even with the tolerances. I wanted the rotary encoder for the fine single digit control over the volume. The case has some thick walls cuz I know I will drop it a couple of times and I'd prefer it stay together.<br>
