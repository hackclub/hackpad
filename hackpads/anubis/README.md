A not-so-little hackpad with 14 keys (12 in a matrix and 2 direct wired) and two EC11 rotary encoders. This was a last minute endeavor, and this is actually the first ever Hack Club thing I'm participating in, so yay! I did have some experience with F360 before but KiCad was a bit unfun and I found it a bit clunky, especially with figuring out how to make renders work fine. My firmware is a bit whack and I do apologize if it doesn't completely work, because I went with what I thought were good sources on how to program using KMK.
