### Why
This macro pad was inspired from the numerous times, when I was using a digital art software, I would realise that for some reason, the b key doesnt stand for brush. sob. 

So the main reason is to help me adapt to different softwares that use different keybinds. Also it looks very cool, totally not the main reason

### Features
The artzelpad features a .91 inch oled screen, that is meant to display current key presses, or  art modes e.g brush, erase, undo, etc.

The current main.py code binds the 3 keys in the most left column as copy paste and undo, while the rest 6 are formatted like the keys wasdeq on qwerty, but uses arrow keys. I'll most likely include layers later on, that will use the top left button to switch.

### Challenges
I do not currently have a dedicated app to code python and like this readmd document haha, so everything i did was in textedit macos.  tysm to friend for helping check errors <3. 
*<sup> and for some reason, since i had musescore downloaded my .md file kept opening it up. sob
