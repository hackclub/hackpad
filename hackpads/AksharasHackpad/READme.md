BOM: 
1 Seeed XIAO RP2040 
6 Cherry MX 1.00u keyswitches 
1 PCB (preferably black)
1 Case bottom (3dp with black filament) 
1 Case top (3dp with black filament) 
1 Plate (laser cut out of acrylic, preferably light blue, but white is fine if that's not an option)
6 DO-35 diodes (through-hole)
6 DSA keycaps (preferably same color as plate)

I was inspired to make this design when I saw this YSWS online and it sounded really fun and the perfect project to expand my engineering experience (having only worked with fusion before this). The hardest challenge I faced was coding the firmware, I had trouble installing and setting up qmk and ran out of time because it wouldn't compile and I didn't know how to fix the error ðŸ˜­ (I've inlcuded the keymap.c and info.json files under hackpad firmware). Overall I learned a lot from this project, I had no idea how to use kicad or qmk at all before this. Thank you so much for the opportunity!
