# HackPad Rev. 1.0 ‚≠ê

## Background: 

I've always wanted to make a hand-held music controller; a keyboard from which I could control my Spotify with it's own dedicated keys. This projected allowed me to do just that. This project presented a learning curve in KiCAD and Fusion, as I had never used either of these tools before. Once assembled, I think it would be awesome to have a music control pad on my desk!
