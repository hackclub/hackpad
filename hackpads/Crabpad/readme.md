I used MX_V2 for the keyswitch footprints. I think in retrospect, I should've added a ground plane

## Firmware Overview
This hackpad uses KMK firmware for everything. 
- The 6 keys currently act as macros I dynamically change them from the mode button thats the 7th key.
- The OLED is a mode displayer  for now thinking of adding a game
I might add more in the future! That's it for now
