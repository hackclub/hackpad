I would like to solder everything myself
# BOM:
- 15x Cherry MX Black switches (through hole)
- 15x 0805 (2012 metric) 1.5x1.40mm HandSolder Diodes (whatever one has specs closest to 1n4148 diodes)
- 1x Alps Alpine EC11E Switch Encoder
- 1x PCB
- 1x SeeedStudio XIAO RP2040 microcontroller
- M3 Heatsed inserts + screws (not sure on length)

# 3D Prints
- 1x Case Top
- 1x Case Bottom
- 1x Rotary encoder cap (scaling is wrong for some reason, i dont need a massive encoder cap!)
