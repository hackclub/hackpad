# A Keyboard
This is a very simple keyboard, almost nothing special except 3 macro/shortcut buttons. The case is a simple minemalistic black design. This is my first keyboard apart from the macropad, so almost evereything with layouts and size and stuff are new for me.
# A bit about layout and such<br/>
The layout is based on a standard iso 75%, with some small changes to allow for integrated arrowkeys. The layout is otherwise standard nordic/swedish.

1x case bottom (black)<br/>
