# Tetris Hackpad!!
Although now I think about it... it honestly feels like a keyboard.  

Either way, this was my first time designing a PCB, overall I think it went pretty well! The case is just a few sheets of acrylic with some standoffs to sandwhich the board in between.

# PCB
Could the PCB be white? Renders coming soon!

[@Jay](https://github.com/Jayx2u) I could not have figured out how to make the case, process images for the silkscreen, or render the PCB without you (or stay sane over the last two weeks for that matter). So, thank you!!
