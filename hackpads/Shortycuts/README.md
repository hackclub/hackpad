This project made me learn fusion 360, which I hope is (and want it to be) the temporary platform before I switch to Blender.

**Inspiration**:
I use a macbook, which is notorious for its keyboard being shiny due to use over time. I wanted to create a macropad that can remove some of the stress by using it to type in my keyboard shortcuts. 


**Challenges**:
Getting the right size for the keys were a challenge for me. I had to redo the drill holes because they were placed wrongly. I think soldering might be another challenge, but I will find out in the future.
