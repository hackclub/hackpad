- This is my first time making anything like this, so if there are any errors, please let me know on the slack @Caleb. Or comment on my PR.
- I would love if I could have a black pcb, (not the usual green)
- Would it be possible to print the bottom of the case in black and laser cut the top in acrylic?

- 5x Cherry MX switches

- 1x EC11 Encoder (with push button, please)
