Hi, it was my first time designing somethoing like that. Because of that I had a lot of trouble with the firmware.
I wanted do do a macropad with nine buttons so that I could put shortcuts for davinci or fusion 360 there.

BOM
-Seeed XIAO RP2040

-Blank DSA keycaps (9x) (Red, Black, White) (I donâ€™t care about the color, preferably one color) 
-SK6812 MINI-E LEDs (9x)
