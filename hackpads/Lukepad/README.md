**Lukepad!**
This is Lukepad, a 12 key, 2 encoder, toggle switching, 2 led, slider, 3 layer, oled macropad.
Finalizing my design for this has been a lengthy process of iterating through designs and making adjustments (especially with the case). Overall this macropad is really gonna boost my productivity an efficiency massively. The firmware is currently in a very preliminary state and I plan to develop the rest of the functionality soon (Prepare for one of the layers to be a calculator!).
