# MayoDevice

Fingers hurt when play osu

So now I can be sure it is a skill issue

MayoDevice is a 4 key Macropad with an OLED display. Uses a custom QMK firmware for RGB lighting and keys-per-second display. Though I'm not sure how well the leds will actually be visible.

Uses low profile switches solely for aesthetic purposes.

**_Made in Kicad_**

Didn't get too creative cause it was my first time doing pcb design, but it was also the most fun and easiest part for me

## CAD Model

|      Fully assembled      |        Yeah it fits        |

**_Made in Fusion_**

I did not like CAD as much - I thought the constraints and designing were pretty cool, but Fusion 360 has a bug on Mac that unfocuses your window when you click on the hierarchy. Both Fusion and FreeCAD also crashed constantly, but Fusion less so. It fits though

## Firmware

**_Made with QMK_**

I'll update this when I actually test it. It built though, and it's supposed to "heat up" with keypresses per second to alter saturation and shifts hue when you tap. The OLED has a rudimentary display as well.
