My hackersPad is made for programers who can use it for keys that are hader to access on the keyboard like the <> keys and the _ key. I will try to make my hackpad keys changable so if the programer wants to change the keys or the configuration then they can.
During the making, I faced alot of difficulties such as onshape errors and pcb wiring but at the end I solved them (hopefully). I hope that my pcb works.
Overall I enjoyed the experience and learned alot, like pcb designing.
