### Inspiration
I wanted to have a macropad that allows me to do anything quickly (like changing microphone volume), while this is not really possible with the current version I plan to add a lot of things to the firmware once I recieve my hackpad.
I would also like to make some small games in it for when tings are loading :D

### Challenges
I struggled a lot with fusion as it was my first time using it, Kicad went pretty smooth.

My very cool macropad thing!
I have some plans to make it more functional but I want to get it first for debugging and stuff.
