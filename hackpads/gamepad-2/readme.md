My first PCB, so be nice lol. I've basically done everything here solely for aestethics, I'm sure there's smarter ways to go about it...

## Case

Also my first 3D model :p  It's okay for a start, might make a few more cases for it in the future for fun. Yes I discovered the tool that rounds the edges and I **had** to use it.
