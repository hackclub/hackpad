# Hackyippee

Hackyippee acts as a volume controller and audio controller with a programmable 128x64 OLED display. The Xiao MCU also has a USB port for usage with other devices. Finally, there are some LEDs for party lighting and fun effects.

## Inspiration

I wanted to make something for my baby cousin to more easily control her parents' music speaker with. She will be unstoppable with full aux capabilities.
