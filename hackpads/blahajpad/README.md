## HajPad

This is my macropad which is designed to be mainly used as a numpad!
I wanted to create this as my new laptop does not have one.
The firmware has support for another layer, so I can set custom macros for specific apps.
It also contains 17 Reverse Mount neopixels for switch backlighting

I think that the hardest part was designing the case, as I could not think of a way to securely mount the PCB. Here are some pictures:
