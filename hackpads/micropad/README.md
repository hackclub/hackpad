# MicroPad

Hey there, thanks for this opportunity to build learn to work with PCBs and build an actual product. Its my first time designing PCBs and doing anything electronic-related, so designing the PCB was certainly a challenge. Its also my first time creating firmware for a keyboard, so I may have compiled it wrongly... Do let me know if any amendments are required.

Once again, thanks for this, I was able to pick up quite a few new skills.


# BOM:
- 8x Cherry MX switches
- 8x Blank DSA keycaps
- 1x PCB
