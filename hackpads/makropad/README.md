# Makropad

[Original Repo](https://github.com/Badbird5907/makropad)

Makropad is my attempt at a custom macropad, inspired by the [Stream Deck Plus](https://www.elgato.com/ca/en/p/stream-deck-plus-black).
It uses Kaith Choc v2 switches, 2 encoders, powered by a RP2040.

A user-friendly BOM can be found [here](https://github.com/Badbird5907/makropad/blob/master/PCB/BOM.md)

## Features
- 2 rotary encoders
- 10 backlit keys
- 128x32 OLED display
