This is my Numpad/Macropad project for Hackpad. This was made so that I can have a number pad since I upgraded my keyboard to a smaller one and I am missing the full numpad size. It features a rotary encoder, 15 switches, and status LEDs.

Fabrication files are in PCB Fab and 3D models. The assembly stl and step should not be printed. PCB fabrication was made using JLC plugin in KiCad
