# SQUAREPAD MACRO

### Staying on-brand with my username.

I made this Hackpad while trying to keep it in the shape of a square. This is my first time working with PCBs, so I hope it works :)

The aim of this macropad is to have it on the side for quick binds. I hope I can program the encoder to act as a multi-layer thing too.

# BOM:

- 8x Cherry MX Switches (hotswap?)
- 8x Through-hole 1N4148 Diodes
- 1x PCB
- 5x M2x6mm Standoffs???
- 1x EC11 Rotary Encoder
- 1x 0.96'' OLED Display (128x32)
- 1x SEEED XIAO RP2040
- 4x screws (unsure of the type)

Huge thanks to the other people in the repository. I probably would've not figured out how to do it without references and/or help from Slack.
Also kudos to Hack Club for this crazy opportunity. :D
