# gpad
a small keypad for playing games with relativly few controls

## Inspiration
Recently, I started to play games that required only a few amount of keys to play.  Combined with a heightened interest in hardware, I decided I wanted to create a small macropad to fulfil this interest.
Initially I decided to create two separate macropads but time and design constraints proved to be too tight for that to be realized.
