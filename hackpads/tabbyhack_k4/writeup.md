# Tabbyhack K4
Hello! This is my hackpad! I used it as a learning opportunity to figure out how to make PCBs and learn CAD software to make a case! This bhas been a lifelong dream of mine and I cant wait to get it in!


## PCB
I went to KiCad and watched various videos and read various tutorials in order to learn PCB design. I went through many iterations of my design before settling on my current one, the K4. I want to use this to pilot some handcrafted Macropad side hustle-type thing.



## CAD
I used OnShape due to its ease of use and versatility with my current computing situation. I chose to make a plate mount, in order to target maximum effectiveness and the easiest mounting method that actually holds up. I sort of gave up around the USB Hole, becauase i messed up some measurements ain that area.


## Firmware
I chose to go with KMK due to its ease of use.
