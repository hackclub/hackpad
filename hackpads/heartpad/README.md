## Firmware
**Things to Test:**

1. Please make sure that the display is working and is showing this image:
<!-- [oled display image](./Firmware/catswhite.bmp) -->
<img src="./Firmware/catswhite.bmp" alt="oled display image" style="height: 100px;"/>

2. Please test the toggle key to toggle between layers

3. Please test the function keys on the first layer. You don't need to test the second layer, since I will use an application to create custom keybinds for those
