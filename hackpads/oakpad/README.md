# OakPad/OakBoard

I have trouble remembering certain shortcuts when coding in VSCode, so I designed this macropad to assist me

This is my first time designing a PCB, so I know this won't be perfect, but in the end mistakes are made so that we learn from them.

I'd also like to thank HackClub for hosting this YSWS events and giving me the opportunity to work on something I long wanted to

## BOM

- 7x keycaps
- 4x THT 5mm LEDs
- 6x THT diodes
- 1x THT DIN0204 150 Ohm resistor
- 4x M3 metric bolt screws with a length of 13-17.5mm
