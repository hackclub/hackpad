# **Inspiration/Challenges**
I created this macropad to learn more about hardware and firmware creation. I wanted to be able to perform my most used functions with singular key presses such as copy/paste and inserting long strings. While working on this hackpad, I encountered issues with the firmware, the pcb, and 3d models associated with the footprints. By looking at other people's submissions and asking for help on slack, I overcame these issues. In the future I want to learn how to integrate QMK firmware and add more advanced animations for the OLED.
