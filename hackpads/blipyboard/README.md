# **Inspiration/Challenges**
I created this macropad to learn more about hardware and firmware creation. While working on this hackpad, I encountered issues with the firmware, the pcb, and 3d models associated with the footprints. By looking at other people's submissions and asking for help on slack, I overcame these issues.
