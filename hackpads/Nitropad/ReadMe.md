My macropad will be used as a keyboard controller for simple control games and arcade games. The hardest
part of this project was the CAD since it required a lot of steps. This project taught me a lot of different
things and it will definetly be helpful for future projects.

Switches - WASD, shift, spacebar
Rotary encoder - Volume
