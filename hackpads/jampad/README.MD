# JamPad
The Jampad is my attempt at making a **decent** macropad.
It includes 7 keys for various macros ( *calculator hotkey anyone?* ) as well as one rotary encoder for media control. 
It's main body is made of two 3-d printed outer shells, held together by m3 screws and heat set inserts with an acrylic plate sandwiched between. This also means the plate can be swapped out relatively painlessly. 
for firmware, It currently has two QMK layers, with a mix of keys I dont have easy acess to on my main keyboard, and keycodes I thought were funny. The 128x32 OLED displays *very important and relevant* information, on loop. 
Overall, I enjoyed this project a fair bit, as it helped introduce me to pcb design something I had never done before. the case design was relatively painless, and designing around the specifics of the PCB was a fun challenge. The most frustrating part was the firmware, but I found that after a good while reading through the QMK and XAIO docs, I got the basics down. I'm really exited to try and experiment and push this board, if I get it. And i've been having a blast helping my friends now that they've started their own. 

9/10 project. Would do again.

# Bill of materials
Slack: @jamdotjar
- 7x Cherry MX-style keyswitches.
- 4x M3x12mm screws
- 4x M3 X D4.6 X L3.6
- 8x 1N4148 Diodes (through hole)
- 1x EC11 Rotary encoder
- 1x 0.91 inch SSD1306 OLED
- 14x Mill-Max 3305s or 0305s.
If possible I would like for the case to be printed in blue (*I also heard a potential of frosted acrylic which I would love for the plate if possible*)
