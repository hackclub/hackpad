# GoosePad

GoosePad is a macropad that looks like a short calculator for some reason(might make it actually a calcutor when I have more time).

## Features

- 14x Keys
- 0.96" OLED screen
- Maybe a calculator in the future

## Firmware

I wrote the firmware using QMK. I had a bunch of errors so I just turned off errors in VSCode lol.

## Challenges

The biggest challege I had was probably aligning things for the case, I also remodeled the case and PCB cause I thought the wall between the OLED and switch was too thin and it probably was.
