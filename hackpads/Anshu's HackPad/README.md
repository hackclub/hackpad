# Inspiration
I made this hackpad to help me be more productive. But mostly I wanted to learn regarding keyboards/macropads so i made one 
# Challenges
This was my first time working with fusin 360 and it was not a smooth sailing I had to watch numerous tutorials and figure out what I was doing especially during the initial stages I did not know how anything worked. However after a long time I was able to figure out and finally design my case. 
The most challenging part was designing the front plate and aliging the keys.
