# SwiftPad: The Minimal Productivity Based Macropad?

Meet Swift, The most fastest way and the best way to get tasks done quicckkk! 
Swift is design for me to use it mainly with my iPad since it makes my workflow easier. 


## Swift Features:
- A rotary Encoder! (with a built-in switch to change layers)
- A OLED 0.91 inch screen! (Not too big but gets the job done)
- 9 MX switches
- 4 unused LEDS (for now)(Low powered single colored orange leds)
- A TruchetTiles Pattern (Credits to created of Macroboard for the pattern)

Swift Pad runs on the KMK firmware which is built on python (the only language im confident in)
