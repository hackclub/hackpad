## Inspiration

My motivation is partially based on how easy it is to do something. If something requires a lot of tedious, repetitive effort, it creates a mental block that discourages me from completing the task. I created this macropad counter this effect, with the hopes that being able to do certain actions at the click of a button would encourage me to complete projects.

## Challenges

Bro when I tell you I STRUGGLED. I was literally thiiiis close to just giving up. At first, I couldn't route my diodes properly because of a problem with the footprints. At another occasion, I couldn't properly design my plate because I had created it on the wrong layer TT. I'm appreciative of google and those who helped me get this far, or else I wouldn't have made this submission
